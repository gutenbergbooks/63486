teach you to pray. Remember Luther&#8217;s maxim,

<p><i>Recreation to a minister must be as whetting is with
the mower&mdash;that is, to be used only so far as is necessary
for his work. May a physician in plague-time
take any more relaxation or recreation than is necessary
for his life, when so many are expecting his help in a
case of life and death? Will you stand by and see
sinners gasping under the pangs of death, and say:
&#8220;God doth not require me to make myself a drudge to
save them?&#8221; Is this the voice of ministerial or Christian
compassion or rather of sensual laziness and diabolical
cruelty?</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Richard Baxter.</span></p>

<p><i>Misemployment of time is injurious to the mind.
In illness I have looked back with self-reproach on days
spent in my study: I was wading through history
and poetry and monthly journals, but I was in my
study! Another man&#8217;s trifling is notorious to all observers,
but what am I doing? Nothing, perhaps,
that has a reference to the spiritual good of my congregation.
Be much in retirement and prayer. Study
the honor and glory of your Master.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Richard Cecil.</span></p></div>

<p><i>Study universal holiness of life. Your whole usefulness
depends on this, for your sermons last but an
hour or two; your life preaches all the week. If Satan
can only make a covetous minister a lover of praise, of
pleasure, of good eating, he has ruined your ministry.
Give yourself to prayer, and get your texts, your
thoughts, your words from God. Luther spent his
best three hours in prayer.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Robert Murray McCheyne.</span></p></div>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> are constantly on a stretch, if not
on a strain, to devise new methods, new
plans, new organizations to advance the
Church and secure enlargement and efficiency
for the gospel. This trend of the
day has a tendency to lose sight of the man
or sink the man in the plan or organization.
God&#8217;s plan is to make much of the
man, far more of him than of anything
else. Men are God&#8217;s method. The Church
is looking for better methods; God is looking
for better men. &#8220;There was a man sent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
from God whose name was John.&#8221; The
dispensation that heralded and prepared the
way for Christ was bound up in that man
John. &#8220;Unto us a child is born, unto us a
son is given.&#8221; The world&#8217;s salvation comes
out of that cradled Son. When Paul appeals
to the personal character of the men
who rooted the gospel in the world, he
solves the mystery of their success. The
glory and efficiency of the gospel is staked
on the men who proclaim it. When God
declares that &#8220;the eyes of the Lord run to
and fro throughout the whole earth, to
show himself strong in the behalf of them
whose heart is perfect toward him,&#8221; he declares
the necessity of men and his dependence
on them as a channel through which to
exert his power upon the world. This vital,
urgent truth is one that this age of machinery
is apt to forget. The forgetting of
it is as baneful on the work of God as
would be the striking of the sun from his
sphere. Darkness, confusion, and death
would ensue.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>What the Church needs to-day is not
more machinery or better, not new organizations
or more and novel methods, but
men whom the Holy Ghost can use&mdash;men
of prayer, men mighty in prayer. The
Holy Ghost does not flow through methods,
but through men. He does not come
on machinery, but on men. He does not
anoint plans, but men&mdash;men of prayer.</p>

<p>An eminent historian has said that the
accidents of personal character have more
to do with the revolutions of nations than
either philosophic historians or democratic
politicians will allow. This truth has its
application in full to the gospel of Christ,
the character and conduct of the followers
of Christ&mdash;Christianize the world, transfigure
nations and individuals. Of the
preachers of the gospel it is eminently true.</p>

<p>The character as well as the fortunes of
the gospel is committed to the preacher.
He makes or mars the message from God
to man. The preacher is the golden pipe
through which the divine oil flows. The
pipe must not only be golden, but open<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
and flawless, that the oil may have a full,
unhindered, unwasted flow.</p>

<p>The man makes the preacher. God must
make the man. The messenger is, if possible,
more than the message. The preacher
is more than the sermon. The preacher
makes the sermon. As the life-giving
milk from the mother&#8217;s bosom is but the
mother&#8217;s life, so all the preacher says is
tinctured, impregnated by what the preacher
is. The treasure is in earthen vessels,
and the taste of the vessel impregnates
and may discolor. The man, the whole
man, lies behind the sermon. Preaching is
not the performance of an hour. It is the
outflow of a life. It takes twenty years to
make a sermon, because it takes twenty
years to make the man. The true sermon
is a thing of life. The sermon grows because
the man grows. The sermon is forceful
because the man is forceful. The sermon
is holy because the man is holy. The
sermon is full of the divine unction because
the man is full of the divine unction.</p>

<p>Paul termed it &#8220;My gospel;&#8221; not that he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
had degraded it by his personal eccentricities
or diverted it by selfish appropriation,
but the gospel was put into the heart and
lifeblood of the man Paul, as a personal
trust to be executed by his Pauline traits,
to be set aflame and empowered by the
fiery energy of his fiery soul. Paul&#8217;s sermons&mdash;what
were they? Where are they?
Skeletons, scattered fragments, afloat on
the sea of inspiration! But the man Paul,
greater than his sermons, lives forever, in
full form, feature, and stature, with his
molding hand on the Church. The preaching
is but a voice. The voice in silence
dies, the text is forgotten, the sermon fades
from memory; the preacher lives.</p>

<p>The sermon cannot rise in its life-giving
forces above the man. Dead men give out
dead sermons, and dead sermons kill. Everything
depends on the spiritual character
of the preacher. Under the Jewish dispensation
the high priest had inscribed in jeweled
letters on a golden frontlet: &#8220;Holiness
to the Lord.&#8221; So every preacher in Christ&#8217;s
ministry must be molded into and mastered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
by this same holy motto. It is a crying
shame for the Christian ministry to fall
lower in holiness of character and holiness
of aim than the Jewish priesthood. Jonathan
Edwards said: &#8220;I went on with my
eager pursuit after more holiness and conformity
to Christ. The heaven I desired
was a heaven of holiness.&#8221; The gospel of
Christ does not move by popular waves.
It has no self-propagating power. It moves
as the men who have charge of it move.
The preacher must impersonate the gospel.
Its divine, most distinctive features must be
embodied in him. The constraining power
of love must be in the preacher as a projecting,
eccentric, an all-commanding, self-oblivious
force. The energy of self-denial
must be his being, his heart and blood and
bones. He must go forth as a man among
men, clothed with humility, abiding in
meekness, wise as a serpent, harmless as
a dove; the bonds of a servant with the
spirit of a king, a king in high, royal, independent
bearing, with the simplicity and
sweetness of a child. The preacher must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
throw himself, with all the abandon of a
perfect, self-emptying faith and a self-consuming
zeal, into his work for the salvation
of men. Hearty, heroic, compassionate,
fearless martyrs must the men be who take
hold of and shape a generation for God. If
they be timid timeservers, place seekers,
if they be men pleasers or men fearers, if
their faith has a weak hold on God or his
Word, if their denial be broken by any
phase of self or the world, they cannot take
hold of the Church nor the world for God.</p>

<p>The preacher&#8217;s sharpest and strongest
preaching should be to himself. His most
difficult, delicate, laborious, and thorough
work must be with himself. The training
of the twelve was the great, difficult, and
enduring work of Christ. Preachers are
not sermon makers, but men makers and
saint makers, and he only is well-trained
for this business who has made himself a
man and a saint. It is not great talents
nor great learning nor great preachers that
God needs, but men great in holiness, great
in faith, great in love, great in fidelity, great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
for God&mdash;men always preaching by holy
sermons in the pulpit, by holy lives out of it.
These can mold a generation for God.</p>

<p>After this order, the early Christians
were formed. Men they were of solid
mold, preachers after the heavenly type&mdash;heroic,
stalwart, soldierly, saintly. Preaching
with them meant self-denying, self-crucifying,
serious, toilsome, martyr business.
They applied themselves to it in a way that
told on their generation, and formed in its
womb a generation yet unborn for God.
The preaching man is to be the praying
man. Prayer is the preacher&#8217;s mightiest
weapon. An almighty force in itself, it
gives life and force to all.</p>

<p>The real sermon is made in the closet.
The man&mdash;God&#8217;s man&mdash;is made in the closet.
His life and his profoundest convictions
were born in his secret communion
with God. The burdened and tearful agony
of his spirit, his weightiest and sweetest
messages were got when alone with God.
Prayer makes the man; prayer makes the
preacher; prayer makes the pastor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>The pulpit of this day is weak in praying.
The pride of learning is against the
dependent humility of prayer. Prayer is
with the pulpit too often only official&mdash;a
performance for the routine of service.
Prayer is not to the modern pulpit the
mighty force it was in Paul&#8217;s life or Paul&#8217;s
ministry. Every preacher who does not
make prayer a mighty factor in his own
life and ministry is weak as a factor in
God&#8217;s work and is powerless to project
God&#8217;s cause in this world.</p>

<p><i>But above all he excelled in prayer. The inwardness
and weight of his spirit, the reverence and solemnity
of his address and behavior, and the fewness
and fullness of his words have often struck even
strangers with admiration as they used to reach others
with consolation. The most awful, living, reverend
frame I ever felt or beheld, I must say, was his prayer.
And truly it was a testimony. He knew and lived
nearer to the Lord than other men, for they that know
him most will see most reason to approach him with
reverence and fear.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">William
Penn of George Fox.</span></p></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sweetest graces by a slight perversion
may bear the bitterest fruit. The sun
gives life, but sunstrokes are death.
Preaching is to give life; it may kill. The
preacher holds the keys; he may lock as
well as unlock. Preaching is God&#8217;s great
institution for the planting and maturing
of spiritual life. When properly executed,
its benefits are untold; when wrongly executed,
no evil can exceed its damaging results.
It is an easy matter to destroy the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
flock if the shepherd be unwary or the pasture
be destroyed, easy to capture the citadel
if the watchmen be asleep or the food
and water be poisoned. Invested with such
gracious prerogatives, exposed to so great
evils, involving so many grave responsibilities,
it would be a parody on the shrewdness
of the devil and a libel on his character
and reputation if he did not bring his master
influences to adulterate the preacher and
the preaching. In face of all this, the exclamatory
interrogatory of Paul, &#8220;Who is
sufficient for these things?&#8221; is never out of
order.</p>

<p>Paul says: &#8220;Our sufficiency is of God,
who also hath made us able ministers of the
new testament; not of the letter, but of the
spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit
giveth life.&#8221; The true ministry is God-touched,
God-enabled, and God-made. The
Spirit of God is on the preacher in anointing
power, the fruit of the Spirit is in his
heart, the Spirit of God has vitalized the
man and the word; his preaching gives
life, gives life as the spring gives life;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
gives life as the resurrection gives life;
gives ardent life as the summer gives ardent
life; gives fruitful life as the autumn
gives fruitful life. The life-giving preacher
is a man of God, whose heart is ever
athirst for God, whose soul is ever following
hard after God, whose eye is single to
God, and in whom by the power of God&#8217;s
Spirit the flesh and the world have been
crucified and his ministry is like the generous
flood of a life-giving river.</p>

<p>The preaching that kills is nonspiritual
preaching. The ability of the preaching is
not from God. Lower sources than God
have given to it energy and stimulant. The
Spirit is not evident in the preacher nor his
preaching. Many kinds of forces may be
projected and stimulated by preaching that
kills, but they are not spiritual forces. They
may resemble spiritual forces, but are only
the shadow, the counterfeit; life they may
seem to have, but the life is magnetized.
The preaching that kills is the letter; shapely
and orderly it may be, but it is the letter
still, the dry, husky letter, the empty, bald<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
shell. The letter may have the germ of
life in it, but it has no breath of spring to
evoke it; winter seeds they are, as hard
as the winter&#8217;s soil, as icy as the winter&#8217;s
air, no thawing nor germinating by them.
This letter-preaching has the truth. But
even divine truth has no life-giving energy
alone; it must be energized by the Spirit,
with all God&#8217;s forces at its back. Truth
unquickened by God&#8217;s Spirit deadens as
much as, or more than, error. It may be
the truth without admixture; but without
the Spirit its shade and touch are deadly,
its truth error, its light darkness. The letter-preaching
is unctionless, neither mellowed
nor oiled by the Spirit. There may
be tears, but tears cannot run God&#8217;s machinery;
tears may be but summer&#8217;s breath
on a snow-covered iceberg, nothing but
surface slush. Feelings and earnestness
there may be, but it is the emotion of the
actor and the earnestness of the attorney.
The preacher may feel from the kindling of
his own sparks, be eloquent over his own
exegesis, earnest in delivering the product<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
of his own brain; the professor may usurp
the place and imitate the fire of the apostle;
brains and nerves may serve the place
and feign the work of God&#8217;s Spirit, and
by these forces the letter may glow and
sparkle like an illumined text, but the glow
and sparkle will be as barren of life as the
field sown with pearls. The death-dealing
element lies back of the words, back of the
sermon, back of the occasion, back of the
manner, back of the action. The great
hindrance is in the preacher himself. He
has not in himself the mighty life-creating
forces. There may be no discount on his
orthodoxy, honesty, cleanness, or earnestness;
but somehow the man, the inner man,
in its secret places has never broken down
and surrendered to God, his inner life is
not a great highway for the transmission
of God&#8217;s message, God&#8217;s power. Somehow
self and not God rules in the holy of holies.
Somewhere, all unconscious to himself,
some spiritual nonconductor has touched
his inner being, and the divine current has
been arrested. His inner being has never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
felt its thorough spiritual bankruptcy, its
utter powerlessness; he has never learned to
cry out with an ineffable cry of self-despair
and self-helplessness till God&#8217;s power and
God&#8217;s fire comes in and fills, purifies, empowers.
Self-esteem, self-ability in some
pernicious shape has defamed and violated
the temple which should be held sacred
for God. Life-giving preaching costs the
preacher much&mdash;death to self, crucifixion to
the world, the travail of his own soul. Crucified
preaching only can give life. Crucified
preaching can come only from a crucified
man.</p>

<p><i>During this affliction I was brought to examine my

was different. My returns of gratitude and loving
obedience bear no proportion to my obligations for redeeming,
preserving, and supporting me through the
vicissitudes of life from infancy to old age. The
coldness of my love to Him who first loved me and has
done so much for me overwhelmed and confused me;
and to complete my unworthy character, I had not only
neglected to improve the grace given to the extent of
my duty and privilege, but for want of that improvement
had, while abounding in perplexing care and
labor, declined from first zeal and love. I was confounded,
humbled myself, implored mercy, and renewed
my covenant to strive and devote myself unreservedly
to the Lord.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bishop McKendree.</span></p></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> preaching that kills may be, and
often is, orthodox&mdash;dogmatically, inviolably
orthodox. We love orthodoxy. It is good.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
It is the best. It is the clean, clear-cut
teaching of God&#8217;s Word, the trophies won
by truth in its conflict with error, the levees
which faith has raised against the desolating
floods of honest or reckless misbelief
or unbelief; but orthodoxy, clear and hard
as crystal, suspicious and militant, may be
but the letter well-shaped, well-named, and
well-learned, the letter which kills. Nothing
is so dead as a dead orthodoxy, too
dead to speculate, too dead to think, to
study, or to pray.</p>

<p>The preaching that kills may have insight
and grasp of principles, may be scholarly
and critical in taste, may have every
minuti&aelig; of the derivation and grammar of
the letter, may be able to trim the letter
into its perfect pattern, and illume it as
Plato and Cicero may be illumined, may
study it as a lawyer studies his text-books
to form his brief or to defend his case, and
yet be like a frost, a killing frost. Letter-preaching
may be eloquent, enameled with
poetry and rhetoric, sprinkled with prayer,
spiced with sensation, illumined by genius,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
and yet these be but the massive or chaste,
costly mountings, the rare and beautiful
flowers which coffin the corpse. The
preaching which kills may be without scholarship,
unmarked by any freshness of
thought or feeling, clothed in tasteless generalities
or vapid specialties, with style irregular,
slovenly, savoring neither of closet
nor of study, graced neither by thought, expression,
or prayer. Under such preaching
how wide and utter the desolation! how
profound the spiritual death!</p>

<p>This letter-preaching deals with the surface
and shadow of things, and not the
things themselves. It does not penetrate
the inner part. It has no deep insight into,
no strong grasp of, the hidden life of God&#8217;s
Word. It is true to the outside, but the outside
is the hull which must be broken and
penetrated for the kernel. The letter may
be dressed so as to attract and be fashionable,
but the attraction is not toward God
nor is the fashion for heaven. The failure
is in the preacher. God has not made him.
He has never been in the hands of God like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
clay in the hands of the potter. He has
been busy about the sermon, its thought
and finish, its drawing and impressive
forces; but the deep things of God have
never been sought, studied, fathomed, experienced
by him. He has never stood
before &#8220;the throne high and lifted up,&#8221;
never heard the seraphim song, never seen
the vision nor felt the rush of that awful
holiness, and cried out in utter abandon and
despair under the sense of weakness and
guilt, and had his life renewed, his heart
touched, purged, inflamed by the live coal
from God&#8217;s altar. His ministry may draw
people to him, to the Church, to the form
and ceremony; but no true drawings to
God, no sweet, holy, divine communion induced.
The Church has been frescoed but
not edified, pleased but not sanctified. Life
is suppressed; a chill is on the summer
air; the soil is baked. The city of our God
becomes the city of the dead; the Church
a graveyard, not an embattled army.
Praise and prayer are stifled; worship is
dead. The preacher and the preaching have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
helped sin, not holiness; peopled hell, not
heaven.</p>

<p>Preaching which kills is prayerless
preaching. Without prayer the preacher
creates death, and not life. The preacher
who is feeble in prayer is feeble in life-giving
forces. The preacher who has retired
prayer as a conspicuous and largely
prevailing element in his own character
has shorn his preaching of its distinctive
life-giving power. Professional praying
there is and will be, but professional
praying helps the preaching to its deadly
work. Professional praying chills and
kills both preaching and praying. Much
of the lax devotion and lazy, irreverent
attitudes in congregational praying are
attributable to professional praying in the
pulpit. Long, discursive, dry, and inane
are the prayers in many pulpits. Without
unction or heart, they fall like a killing
frost on all the graces of worship.
Death-dealing prayers they are. Every
vestige of devotion has perished under
their breath. The deader they are the
longer they grow. A plea for short<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
praying, live praying, real heart praying,
praying by the Holy Spirit&mdash;direct, specific,
ardent, simple, unctuous in the pulpit&mdash;is
in order. A school to teach preachers how
to pray, as God counts praying, would be
more beneficial to true piety, true worship,
and true preaching than all theological
schools.</p>

<p>Stop! Pause! Consider! Where are
we? What are we doing? Preaching to
kill? Praying to kill? Praying to God!
the great God, the Maker of all worlds, the
Judge of all men! What reverence! what
simplicity! what sincerity! what truth in
the inward parts is demanded! How real
we must be! How hearty! Prayer to God
the noblest exercise, the loftiest effort of
man, the most real thing! Shall we not
discard forever accursed preaching that
kills and prayer that kills, and do the real
thing, the mightiest thing&mdash;prayerful praying,
life-creating preaching, bring the
mightiest force to bear on heaven and earth
and draw on God&#8217;s exhaustless and open
treasure for the need and beggary of man?</p>

<p><i>Let us often look at Brainerd in the woods of
America pouring out his very soul before God for the
perishing heathen without whose salvation nothing
could make him happy. Prayer&mdash;secret, fervent, believing
prayer&mdash;lies at the root of all personal godliness.
A competent knowledge of the language where
a missionary lives, a mild and winning temper, a heart
given up to God in closet religion&mdash;these, these are the
attainments which, more than all knowledge, or all
other gifts, will fit us to become the instruments of God
in the great work of human redemption.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Carey&#8217;s
Brotherhood, Serampore.</span></p></div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are two extreme tendencies in the
ministry. The one is to shut itself out from
intercourse with the people. The monk,
the hermit were illustrations of this; they
shut themselves out from men to be more
with God. They failed, of course. Our
being with God is of use only as we expend
its priceless benefits on men. This
age, neither with preacher nor with people,
is much intent on God. Our hankering is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
not that way. We shut ourselves to our
study, we become students, bookworms, Bible
worms, sermon makers, noted for literature,
thought, and sermons; but the people
and God, where are they? Out of heart,
out of mind. Preachers who are great
thinkers, great students must be the greatest
of prayers, or else they will be the greatest
of backsliders, heartless professionals,
rationalistic, less than the least of preachers
in God&#8217;s estimate.</p>

<p>The other tendency is to thoroughly popularize
the ministry. He is no longer
God&#8217;s man, but a man of affairs, of the
people. He prays not, because his mission
is to the people. If he can move the people,
create an interest, a sensation in favor
of religion, an interest in Church work&mdash;he
is satisfied. His personal relation to
God is no factor in his work. Prayer has
little or no place in his plans. The disaster
and ruin of such a ministry cannot be computed
by earthly arithmetic. What the
preacher is in prayer to God, for himself,
for his people, so is his power for real good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
to men, so is his true fruitfulness, his true
fidelity to God, to man, for time, for eternity.</p>

<p>It is impossible for the preacher to keep
his spirit in harmony with the divine nature
of his high calling without much prayer.
That the preacher by dint of duty and
laborious fidelity to the work and routine of
the ministry can keep himself in trim and
fitness is a serious mistake. Even sermon-making,
incessant and taxing as an art, as
a duty, as a work, or as a pleasure, will
engross and harden, will estrange the heart,
by neglect of prayer, from God. The scientist
loses God in nature. The preacher
may lose God in his sermon.</p>

<p>Prayer freshens the heart of the preacher,
keeps it in tune with God and in sympathy
with the people, lifts his ministry out
of the chilly air of a profession, fructifies
routine and moves every wheel with the
facility and power of a divine unction.</p>

<p>Mr. Spurgeon says: &#8220;Of course the
preacher is above all others distinguished
as a man of prayer. He prays as an ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
Christian, else he were a hypocrite.
He prays more than ordinary Christians,
else he were disqualified for the office he
has undertaken. If you as ministers are
not very prayerful, you are to be pitied. If
you become lax in sacred devotion, not only
will you need to be pitied but your people
also, and the day cometh in which you
shall be ashamed and confounded. All our
libraries and studies are mere emptiness
compared with our closets. Our seasons
of fasting and prayer at the Tabernacle
have been high days indeed; never has
heaven&#8217;s gate stood wider; never have our
hearts been nearer the central Glory.&#8221;</p>

<p>The praying which makes a prayerful
ministry is not a little praying put in as we
put flavor to give it a pleasant smack, but
the praying must be in the body, and form
the blood and bones. Prayer is no petty
duty, put into a corner; no piecemeal performance
made out of the fragments of
time which have been snatched from business
and other engagements of life; but
it means that the best of our time, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
heart of our time and strength must be
given. It does not mean the closet absorbed
in the study or swallowed up in the
activities of ministerial duties; but it means
the closet first, the study and activities second,
both study and activities freshened
and made efficient by the closet. Prayer
that affects one&#8217;s ministry must give tone
to one&#8217;s life. The praying which gives color
and bent to character is no pleasant, hurried
pastime. It must enter as strongly
into the heart and life as Christ&#8217;s &#8220;strong
crying and tears&#8221; did; must draw out the
soul into an agony of desire as Paul&#8217;s did;
must be an inwrought fire and force like
the &#8220;effectual, fervent prayer&#8221; of James;
must be of that quality which, when put into
the golden censer and incensed before God,
works mighty spiritual throes and revolutions.</p>

<p>Prayer is not a little habit pinned on to
us while we were tied to our mother&#8217;s apron
strings; neither is it a little decent quarter
of a minute&#8217;s grace said over an hour&#8217;s
dinner, but it is a most serious work of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
our most serious years. It engages more
of time and appetite than our longest dinings
or richest feasts. The prayer that
makes much of our preaching must be
made much of. The character of our praying
will determine the character of our
preaching. Light praying will make light
preaching. Prayer makes preaching
strong, gives it unction, and makes it stick.
In every ministry weighty for good, prayer
has always been a serious business.</p>

<p>The preacher must be pre&euml;minently a
man of prayer. His heart must graduate
in the school of prayer. In the school of
prayer only can the heart learn to preach.
No learning can make up for the failure to
pray. No earnestness, no diligence, no
study, no gifts will supply its lack.</p>

<p>Talking to men for God is a great thing,
but talking to God for men is greater still.
He will never talk well and with real success
to men for God who has not learned
well how to talk to God for men. More
than this, prayerless words in the pulpit
and out of it are deadening words.</p>

all price. Never, never neglect it.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir

<p><i>Prayer is the first thing, the second thing, the third
thing necessary to a minister. Pray, then, my dear

<p><span class="smcap">Prayer</span>, in the preacher&#8217;s life, in the
preacher&#8217;s study, in the preacher&#8217;s pulpit,
must be a conspicuous and an all-impregnating
force and an all-coloring ingredient.
It must play no secondary part, be no mere
coating. To him it is given to be with his
Lord &#8220;all night in prayer.&#8221; The preacher,
to train himself in self-denying prayer, is
charged to look to his Master, who, &#8220;rising
up a great while before day, went out,
and departed into a solitary place, and there
prayed.&#8221; The preacher&#8217;s study ought to be
a closet, a Bethel, an altar, a vision, and a
ladder, that every thought might ascend
heavenward ere it went manward; that every
part of the sermon might be scented by
the air of heaven and made serious, because
God was in the study.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>As the engine never moves until the fire
is kindled, so preaching, with all its machinery,
perfection, and polish, is at a dead
standstill, as far as spiritual results are
concerned, till prayer has kindled and created
the steam. The texture, fineness, and
strength of the sermon is as so much rubbish
unless the mighty impulse of prayer
is in it, through it, and behind it. The
preacher must, by prayer, put God in the
sermon. The preacher must, by prayer,
move God toward the people before he can
move the people to God by his words. The
preacher must have had audience and ready
access to God before he can have access to
the people. An open way to God for the
preacher is the surest pledge of an open
way to the people.</p>

<p>It is necessary to iterate and reiterate that
prayer, as a mere habit, as a performance
gone through by routine or in a professional
way, is a dead and rotten thing. Such
praying has no connection with the praying
for which we plead. We are stressing true<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
praying, which engages and sets on fire every
high element of the preacher&#8217;s being&mdash;prayer
which is born of vital oneness with
Christ and the fullness of the Holy Ghost,
which springs from the deep, overflowing
fountains of tender compassion, deathless
solicitude for man&#8217;s eternal good; a consuming
zeal for the glory of God; a thorough
conviction of the preacher&#8217;s difficult
and delicate work and of the imperative
need of God&#8217;s mightiest help. Praying
grounded on these solemn and profound
convictions is the only true praying.
Preaching backed by such praying is the
only preaching which sows the seeds of
eternal life in human hearts and builds men
up for heaven.</p>

<p>It is true that there may be popular
preaching, pleasant preaching, taking
preaching, preaching of much intellectual,
literary, and brainy force, with its measure
and form of good, with little or no praying;
but the preaching which secures God&#8217;s end
in preaching must be born of prayer from
text to exordium, delivered with the energy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
and spirit of prayer, followed and made to
germinate, and kept in vital force in the
hearts of the hearers by the preacher&#8217;s
prayers, long after the occasion has past.</p>

<p>We may excuse the spiritual poverty of
our preaching in many ways, but the true
secret will be found in the lack of urgent
prayer for God&#8217;s presence in the power of
the Holy Spirit. There are preachers innumerable
who can deliver masterful sermons
after their order; but the effects are
short-lived and do not enter as a factor at
all into the regions of the spirit where the
fearful war between God and Satan, heaven
and hell, is being waged because they
are not made powerfully militant and spiritually
victorious by prayer.</p>

<p>The preachers who gain mighty results
for God are the men who have prevailed
in their pleadings with God ere venturing
to plead with men. The preachers who are
the mightiest in their closets with God are
the mightiest in their pulpits with men.</p>

<p>Preachers are human folks, and are exposed
to and often caught by the strong<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
driftings of human currents. Praying is
spiritual work; and human nature does not
like taxing, spiritual work. Human nature
wants to sail to heaven under a favoring
breeze, a full, smooth sea. Prayer is humbling
work. It abases intellect and pride,
crucifies vainglory, and signs our spiritual
bankruptcy, and all these are hard for flesh
and blood to bear. It is easier not to pray
than to bear them. So we come to one of
the crying evils of these times, maybe of all
times&mdash;little or no praying. Of these two
evils, perhaps little praying is worse than
no praying. Little praying is a kind of
make-believe, a salvo for the conscience, a
farce and a delusion.</p>

<p>The little estimate we put on prayer is
evident from the little time we give to it.
The time given to prayer by the average
preacher scarcely counts in the sum of the
daily aggregate. Not infrequently the
preacher&#8217;s only praying is by his bedside in
his nightdress, ready for bed and soon in
it, with, perchance, the addition of a few
hasty snatches of prayer ere he is dressed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
in the morning. How feeble, vain, and little
is such praying compared with the time
and energy devoted to praying by holy men
in and out of the Bible! How poor and
mean our petty, childish praying is beside
the habits of the true men of God in all
ages! To men who think praying their
main business and devote time to it according
to this high estimate of its importance
does God commit the keys of his
kingdom, and by them does he work his
spiritual wonders in this world. Great
praying is the sign and seal of God&#8217;s great
leaders and the earnest of the conquering
forces with which God will crown their labors.</p>

<p>The preacher is commissioned to pray as
well as to preach. His mission is incomplete
if he does not do both well. The
preacher may speak with all the eloquence
of men and of angels; but unless he can
pray with a faith which draws all heaven
to his aid, his preaching will be &#8220;as sounding
brass or a tinkling cymbal&#8221; for permanent
God-honoring, soul-saving uses.</p>

<p><i>The principal cause of my leanness and unfruitfulness
is owing to an unaccountable backwardness to
pray. I can write or read or converse or hear with a
ready heart; but prayer is more spiritual and inward
than any of these, and the more spiritual any duty is
the more my carnal heart is apt to start from it.
Prayer and patience and faith are never disappointed.
I have long since learned that if ever I was to be a
minister faith and prayer must make me one. When
I can find my heart in frame and liberty for prayer,
everything else is comparatively easy.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Richard
Newton.</span></p></div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> may be put down as a spiritual axiom
that in every truly successful ministry
prayer is an evident and controlling force&mdash;evident
and controlling in the life of the
preacher, evident and controlling in the
deep spirituality of his work. A ministry
may be a very thoughtful ministry without
prayer; the preacher may secure fame and
popularity without prayer; the whole machinery
of the preacher&#8217;s life and work may
be run without the oil of prayer or with
scarcely enough to grease one cog; but no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
ministry can be a spiritual one, securing
holiness in the preacher and in his people,
without prayer being made an evident and
controlling force.</p>

<p>The preacher that prays indeed puts God
into the work. God does not come into the
preacher&#8217;s work as a matter of course or on
general principles, but he comes by prayer
and special urgency. That God will be
found of us in the day that we seek him
with the whole heart is as true of the
preacher as of the penitent. A prayerful
ministry is the only ministry that brings the
preacher into sympathy with the people.
Prayer as essentially unites to the human
as it does to the divine. A prayerful
ministry is the only ministry qualified for
the high offices and responsibilities of the
preacher. Colleges, learning, books, theology,
preaching cannot make a preacher,
but praying does. The apostles&#8217; commission
to preach was a blank till filled up by
the Pentecost which praying brought. A
prayerful minister has passed beyond the
regions of the popular, beyond the man of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
mere affairs, of secularities, of pulpit attractiveness;
passed beyond the ecclesiastical
organizer or general into a sublimer and
mightier region, the region of the spiritual.
Holiness is the product of his work; transfigured
hearts and lives emblazon the reality
of his work, its trueness and substantial
nature. God is with him. His ministry is
not projected on worldly or surface principles.
He is deeply stored with and deeply
schooled in the things of God. His long,
deep communings with God about his people
and the agony of his wrestling spirit
have crowned him as a prince in the things
of God. The iciness of the mere professional
has long since melted under the intensity
of his praying.</p>

<p>The superficial results of many a ministry,
the deadness of others, are to be found
in the lack of praying. No ministry can
succeed without much praying, and this
praying must be fundamental, ever-abiding,
ever-increasing. The text, the sermon,
should be the result of prayer. The study
should be bathed in prayer, all its duties<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
impregnated with prayer, its whole spirit
the spirit of prayer. &#8220;I am sorry that I
have prayed so little,&#8221; was the deathbed regret
of one of God&#8217;s chosen ones, a sad
and remorseful regret for a preacher. &#8220;I
want a life of greater, deeper, truer
prayer,&#8221; said the late Archbishop Tait. So
may we all say, and this may we all secure.</p>

<p>God&#8217;s true preachers have been distinguished
by one great feature: they were
men of prayer. Differing often in many
things, they have always had a common
center. They may have started from different
points, and traveled by different
roads, but they converged to one point:
they were one in prayer. God to them was
the center of attraction, and prayer was the
path that led to God. These men prayed
not occasionally, not a little at regular or at
odd times; but they so prayed that their
prayers entered into and shaped their characters;
they so prayed as to affect their own
lives and the lives of others; they so prayed
as to make the history of the Church and
influence the current of the times. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
spent much time in prayer, not because they
marked the shadow on the dial or the hands
on the clock, but because it was to them so
momentous and engaging a business that
they could scarcely give over.</p>

<p>Prayer was to them what it was to Paul,
a striving with earnest effort of soul; what
it was to Jacob, a wrestling and prevailing;
what it was to Christ, &#8220;strong crying and
tears.&#8221; They &#8220;prayed always with all
prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and
watching thereunto with all perseverance.&#8221;
&#8220;The effectual, fervent prayer&#8221; has been the
mightiest weapon of God&#8217;s mightiest soldiers.
The statement in regard to Elijah&mdash;that
he &#8220;was a man subject to like passions
as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it
might not rain: and it rained not on the
earth by the space of three years and six
months. And he prayed again, and the
heaven gave rain, and the earth brought
forth her fruit&#8221;&mdash;comprehends all prophets
and preachers who have moved their generation
for God, and shows the instrument
by which they worked their wonders.</p>

<p><i>The great masters and teachers in Christian doctrine
have always found in prayer their highest source
of illumination. Not to go beyond the limits of the
English Church, it is recorded of Bishop Andrewes
that he spent five hours daily on his knees. The

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> many private prayers, in the nature
of things, must be short; while public
prayers, as a rule, ought to be short and
condensed; while there is ample room for
and value put on ejaculatory prayer&mdash;yet
in our private communions with God time
is a feature essential to its value. Much
time spent with God is the secret of all successful
praying. Prayer which is felt as a
mighty force is the mediate or immediate
product of much time spent with God. Our
short prayers owe their point and efficiency
to the long ones that have preceded them.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
The short prevailing prayer cannot be
prayed by one who has not prevailed with
God in a mightier struggle of long continuance.
Jacob&#8217;s victory of faith could
not have been gained without that all-night
wrestling. God&#8217;s acquaintance is not made
by pop calls. God does not bestow his gifts
on the casual or hasty comers and goers.
Much with God alone is the secret of knowing
him and of influence with him. He
yields to the persistency of a faith that
knows him. He bestows his richest gifts
upon those who declare their desire for and
appreciation of those gifts by the constancy
as well as earnestness of their importunity.
Christ, who in this as well as other things
is our Example, spent many whole nights
in prayer. His custom was to pray much.
He had his habitual place to pray. Many
long seasons of praying make up his history
and character. Paul prayed day and
night. It took time from very important
interests for Daniel to pray three times a
day. David&#8217;s morning, noon, and night
praying were doubtless on many occasions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
very protracted. While we have no specific
account of the time these Bible saints
spent in prayer, yet the indications are that
they consumed much time in prayer, and
on some occasions long seasons of praying
was their custom.</p>

<p>We would not have any think that the
value of their prayers is to be measured
by the clock, but our purpose is to impress
on our minds the necessity of being
much alone with God; and that if this feature
has not been produced by our faith,
then our faith is of a feeble and surface
type.</p>

<p>The men who have most fully illustrated
Christ in their character, and have most
powerfully affected the world for him, have
been men who spent so much time with
God as to make it a notable feature of
their lives. Charles Simeon devoted the
hours from four till eight in the morning
to God. Mr. Wesley spent two hours daily
in prayer. He began at four in the morning.
Of him, one who knew him well
wrote: &#8220;He thought prayer to be more his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
business than anything else, and I have
seen him come out of his closet with a
serenity of face next to shining.&#8221; John
Fletcher stained the walls of his room by
the breath of his prayers. Sometimes he
would pray all night; always, frequently,
and with great earnestness. His whole life
was a life of prayer. &#8220;I would not rise
from my seat,&#8221; he said, &#8220;without lifting my
heart to God.&#8221; His greeting to a friend
was always: &#8220;Do I meet you praying?&#8221;
Luther said: &#8220;If I fail to spend two hours
in prayer each morning, the devil gets the
victory through the day. I have so much
business I cannot get on without spending
three hours daily in prayer.&#8221; He had a
motto: &#8220;He that has prayed well has studied
well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Archbishop Leighton was so much alone
with God that he seemed to be in a perpetual
meditation. &#8220;Prayer and praise
were his business and his pleasure,&#8221; says
his biographer. Bishop Ken was so much
with God that his soul was said to be God-enamored.
He was with God before the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
clock struck three every morning. Bishop
Asbury said: &#8220;I propose to rise at four
o&#8217;clock as often as I can and spend two
hours in prayer and meditation.&#8221; Samuel
Rutherford, the fragrance of whose piety
is still rich, rose at three in the morning to
meet God in prayer. Joseph Alleine arose
at four o&#8217;clock for his business of praying
till eight. If he heard other tradesmen plying
their business before he was up, he
would exclaim: &#8220;O how this shames me!
Doth not my Master deserve more than
theirs?&#8221; He who has learned this trade
well draws at will, on sight, and with acceptance
of heaven&#8217;s unfailing bank.</p>

<p>One of the holiest and among the most
gifted of Scotch preachers says: &#8220;I ought
to spend the best hours in communion with
God. It is my noblest and most fruitful employment,
and is not to be thrust into a corner.
The morning hours, from six to eight,
are the most uninterrupted and should be
thus employed. After tea is my best hour,
and that should be solemnly dedicated to
God. I ought not to give up the good old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
habit of prayer before going to bed; but
guard must be kept against sleep. When
I awake in the night, I ought to rise and
pray. A little time after breakfast might
be given to intercession.&#8221; This was the
praying plan of Robert McCheyne. The
memorable Methodist band in their praying
shame us. &#8220;From four to five in the morning,
private prayer; from five to six in the
evening, private prayer.&#8221;</p>

<p>John Welch, the holy and wonderful
Scotch preacher, thought the day ill spent
if he did not spend eight or ten hours in
prayer. He kept a plaid that he might wrap
himself when he arose to pray at night.
His wife would complain when she found
him lying on the ground weeping. He
would reply: &#8220;O woman, I have the souls
of three thousand to answer for, and I
know not how it is with many of them!&#8221;</p>

<p><i>The act of praying is the very highest energy of
which the human mind is capable; praying, that is,
with the total concentration of the faculties. The
great mass of worldly men and of learned men are
absolutely incapable of prayer.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Coleridge.</span></p></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Bishop Wilson</span> says: &#8220;In H. Martyn&#8217;s
journal the spirit of prayer, the time he
devoted to the duty, and his fervor in it
are the first things which strike me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Payson wore the hard-wood boards into
grooves where his knees pressed so often
and so long. His biographer says: &#8220;His
continuing instant in prayer, be his circumstances
what they might, is the most noticeable
fact in his history, and points out
the duty of all who would rival his eminency.
To his ardent and persevering
prayers must no doubt be ascribed in a
great measure his distinguished and almost
uninterrupted success.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Marquis DeRenty, to whom Christ<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
was most precious, ordered his servant to
call him from his devotions at the end of
half an hour. The servant at the time saw
his face through an aperture. It was
marked with such holiness that he hated to
arouse him. His lips were moving, but he
was perfectly silent. He waited until three
half hours had passed; then he called to
him, when he arose from his knees, saying
that the half hour was so short when he
was communing with Christ.</p>

<p>Brainerd said: &#8220;I love to be alone in my
cottage, where I can spend much time in
prayer.&#8221;</p>

<p>William Bramwell is famous in Methodist
annals for personal holiness and for
his wonderful success in preaching and for
the marvelous answers to his prayers. For
hours at a time he would pray. He almost
lived on his knees. He went over his circuits
like a flame of fire. The fire was kindled
by the time he spent in prayer. He
often spent as much as four hours in a
single season of prayer in retirement.</p>

<p>Bishop Andrewes spent the greatest part<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
of five hours every day in prayer and devotion.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Havelock always spent the
first two hours of each day alone with God.
If the encampment was struck at 6 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>,
he would rise at four.</p>

<p>Earl Cairns rose daily at six o&#8217;clock to
secure an hour and a half for the study of
the Bible and for prayer, before conducting
family worship at a quarter to eight.</p>

<p>Dr. Judson&#8217;s success in prayer is attributable
to the fact that he gave much time
to prayer. He says on this point: &#8220;Arrange
thy affairs, if possible, so that thou canst
leisurely devote two or three hours every
day not merely to devotional exercises but
to the very act of secret prayer and communion
with God. Endeavor seven times
a day to withdraw from business and company
and lift up thy soul to God in private
retirement. Begin the day by rising after
midnight and devoting some time amid the
silence and darkness of the night to this sacred
work. Let the hour of opening dawn
find thee at the same work. Let the hours<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
of nine, twelve, three, six, and nine at
night witness the same. Be resolute in his
cause. Make all practicable sacrifices to
maintain it. Consider that thy time is
short, and that business and company must
not be allowed to rob thee of thy God.&#8221;
Impossible, say we, fanatical directions!
Dr. Judson impressed an empire for Christ
and laid the foundations of God&#8217;s kingdom
with imperishable granite in the heart of
Burmah. He was successful, one of the
few men who mightily impressed the world
for Christ. Many men of greater gifts
and genius and learning than he have made
no such impression; their religious work is
like footsteps in the sands, but he has engraven
his work on the adamant. The secret
of its profundity and endurance is
found in the fact that he gave time to
prayer. He kept the iron red-hot with
prayer, and God&#8217;s skill fashioned it with
enduring power. No man can do a great
and enduring work for God who is not a
man of prayer, and no man can be a man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
of prayer who does not give much time to
praying.</p>

<p>Is it true that prayer is simply the compliance
with habit, dull and mechanical?
A petty performance into which we are
trained till tameness, shortness, superficiality
are its chief elements? &#8220;Is it true that
prayer is, as is assumed, little else than
the half-passive play of sentiment which
flows languidly on through the minutes or
hours of easy reverie?&#8221; Canon Liddon
continues: &#8220;Let those who have really
prayed give the answer. They sometimes
describe prayer with the patriarch Jacob as
a wrestling together with an Unseen Power
which may last, not unfrequently in an
earnest life, late into the night hours, or
even to the break of day. Sometimes they
refer to common intercession with St. Paul
as a concerted struggle. They have, when
praying, their eyes fixed on the Great Intercessor
in Gethsemane, upon the drops of
blood which fall to the ground in that
agony of resignation and sacrifice. Importunity
is of the essence of successful prayer.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
Importunity means not dreaminess but
sustained work. It is through prayer especially
that the kingdom of heaven suffereth
violence and the violent take it by force.
It was a saying of the late Bishop Hamilton
that &#8216;No man is likely to do much good
in prayer who does not begin by looking
upon it in the light of a work to be prepared
for and persevered in with all the
earnestness which we bring to bear upon
subjects which are in our opinion at once
most interesting and most necessary.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p><i>I ought to pray before seeing any one. Often
when I sleep long, or meet with others early, it is
eleven or twelve o&#8217;clock before I begin secret prayer.
This is a wretched system. It is unscriptural. Christ
arose before day and went into a solitary place. David
says: &#8220;Early will I seek thee;&#8221; &#8220;Thou shalt early hear
my voice.&#8221; Family prayer loses much of its power
and sweetness, and I can do no good to those who come
to seek from me. The conscience feels guilty, the soul
unfed, the lamp not trimmed. Then when in secret
prayer the soul is often out of tune. I feel it is far
better to begin with God&mdash;to see his face first, to get
my soul near him before it is near another.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Robert
Murray McCheyne.</span></p></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> men who have done the most for
God in this world have been early on their
knees. He who fritters away the early
morning, its opportunity and freshness, in
other pursuits than seeking God will make
poor headway seeking him the rest of the
day. If God is not first in our thoughts
and efforts in the morning, he will be in the
last place the remainder of the day.</p>

<p>Behind this early rising and early praying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
is the ardent desire which presses us
into this pursuit after God. Morning listlessness
is the index to a listless heart. The
heart which is behindhand in seeking God
in the morning has lost its relish for God.
David&#8217;s heart was ardent after God. He
hungered and thirsted after God, and so he
sought God early, before daylight. The
bed and sleep could not chain his soul in its
eagerness after God. Christ longed for
communion with God; and so, rising a great
while before day, he would go out into the
mountain to pray. The disciples, when fully
awake and ashamed of their indulgence,
would know where to find him. We might
go through the list of men who have mightily
impressed the world for God, and we
would find them early after God.</p>

<p>A desire for God which cannot break the
chains of sleep is a weak thing and will do
but little good for God after it has indulged
itself fully. The desire for God
that keeps so far behind the devil and the
world at the beginning of the day will never
catch up.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>It is not simply the getting up that puts
men to the front and makes them captain
generals in God&#8217;s hosts, but it is the ardent
desire which stirs and breaks all self-indulgent
chains. But the getting up gives
vent, increase, and strength to the desire.
If they had lain in bed and indulged themselves,
the desire would have been quenched.
The desire aroused them and put them on
the stretch for God, and this heeding and
acting on the call gave their faith its grasp
on God and gave to their hearts the sweetest
and fullest revelation of God, and this
strength of faith and fullness of revelation
made them saints by eminence, and the halo
of their sainthood has come down to us,
and we have entered on the enjoyment of
their conquests. But we take our fill in
enjoyment, and not in productions. We
build their tombs and write their epitaphs,
but are careful not to follow their examples.</p>

<p>We need a generation of preachers who
seek God and seek him early, who give the
freshness and dew of effort to God, and secure
in return the freshness and fullness of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
his power that he may be as the dew to
them, full of gladness and strength, through
all the heat and labor of the day. Our laziness
after God is our crying sin. The children
of this world are far wiser than we.
They are at it early and late. We do not
seek God with ardor and diligence. No
man gets God who does not follow hard
after him, and no soul follows hard after
God who is not after him in early morn.</p>

<p><i>There is a manifest want of spiritual influence on
the ministry of the present day. I feel it in my own
case and I see it in that of others. I am afraid there
is too much of a low, managing, contriving, maneuvering
temper of mind among us. We are laying ourselves
out more than is expedient to meet one man&#8217;s
taste and another man&#8217;s prejudices. The ministry is
a grand and holy affair, and it should find in us a simple
habit of spirit and a holy but humble indifference
to all consequences. The leading defect in Christian
ministers is want of a devotional habit.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Richard
Cecil.</span></p></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Never</span> was there greater need for saintly
men and women; more imperative still is
the call for saintly, God-devoted preachers.
The world moves with gigantic
strides. Satan has his hold and rule on
the world, and labors to make all its movements
subserve his ends. Religion must
do its best work, present its most attractive
and perfect models. By every means, modern
sainthood must be inspired by the loftiest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
ideals and by the largest possibilities
through the Spirit. Paul lived on his
knees, that the Ephesian Church might
measure the heights, breadths, and depths
of an unmeasurable saintliness, and &#8220;be
filled with all the fullness of God.&#8221; Epaphras
laid himself out with the exhaustive
toil and strenuous conflict of fervent prayer,
that the Colossian Church might &#8220;stand
perfect and complete in all the will of God.&#8221;
Everywhere, everything in apostolic times
was on the stretch that the people of God
might each and &#8220;all come in the unity of
the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son
of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure
of the stature of the fullness of
Christ.&#8221; No premium was given to dwarfs;
no encouragement to an old babyhood.
The babies were to grow; the old, instead
of feebleness and infirmities, were to bear
fruit in old age, and be fat and flourishing.
The divinest thing in religion is holy men
and holy women.</p>

<p>No amount of money, genius, or culture
can move things for God. Holiness energizing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
the soul, the whole man aflame
with love, with desire for more faith, more
prayer, more zeal, more consecration&mdash;this
is the secret of power. These we need and
must have, and men must be the incarnation
of this God-inflamed devotedness.
God&#8217;s advance has been stayed, his cause
crippled, his name dishonored for their
lack. Genius (though the loftiest and most
gifted), education (though the most
learned and refined), position, dignity,
place, honored names, high ecclesiastics
cannot move this chariot of our God. It is
a fiery one, and fiery forces only can move
it. The genius of a Milton fails. The imperial
strength of a Leo fails. Brainerd&#8217;s
spirit can move it. Brainerd&#8217;s spirit was
on fire for God, on fire for souls. Nothing
earthly, worldly, selfish came in to abate
in the least the intensity of this all-impelling
and all-consuming force and flame.</p>

<p>Prayer is the creator as well as the channel
of devotion. The spirit of devotion is
the spirit of prayer. Prayer and devotion
are united as soul and body are united, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
life and the heart are united. There is no
real prayer without devotion, no devotion
without prayer. The preacher must be surrendered
to God in the holiest devotion.
He is not a professional man, his ministry
is not a profession; it is a divine institution,
a divine devotion. He is devoted to God.
His aim, aspirations, ambition are for God
and to God, and to such prayer is as essential
as food is to life.</p>

<p>The preacher, above everything else,
must be devoted to God. The preacher&#8217;s
relations to God are the insignia and credentials
of his ministry. These must be
clear, conclusive, unmistakable. No common,
surface type of piety must be his. If
he does not excel in grace, he does not excel
at all. If he does not preach by life,
character, conduct, he does not preach at
all. If his piety be light, his preaching may
be as soft and as sweet as music, as gifted
as Apollo, yet its weight will be a feather&#8217;s
weight, visionary, fleeting as the morning
cloud or the early dew. Devotion to God&mdash;there
is no substitute for this in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
preacher&#8217;s character and conduct. Devotion
to a Church, to opinions, to an organization,
to orthodoxy&mdash;these are paltry, misleading,
and vain when they become the
source of inspiration, the animus of a call.
God must be the mainspring of the preacher&#8217;s
effort, the fountain and crown of all
his toil. The name and honor of Jesus
Christ, the advance of his cause, must be
all in all. The preacher must have no inspiration
but the name of Jesus Christ, no
ambition but to have him glorified, no toil
but for him. Then prayer will be a source
of his illuminations, the means of perpetual
advance, the gauge of his success. The
perpetual aim, the only ambition, the
preacher can cherish is to have God with
him.</p>

<p>Never did the cause of God need perfect
illustrations of the possibilities of
prayer more than in this age. No age, no
person, will be ensamples of the gospel power
except the ages or persons of deep and
earnest prayer. A prayerless age will have
but scant models of divine power. Prayerless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
hearts will never rise to these Alpine
heights. The age may be a better age than
the past, but there is an infinite distance
between the betterment of an age by the
force of an advancing civilization and its
betterment by the increase of holiness and
Christlikeness by the energy of prayer.
The Jews were much better when Christ
came than in the ages before. It was the
golden age of their Pharisaic religion.
Their golden religious age crucified Christ.
Never more praying, never less praying;
never more sacrifices, never less sacrifice;
never less idolatry, never more idolatry;
never more of temple worship, never less
of God worship; never more of lip service,
never less of heart service (God worshiped
by lips whose hearts and hands crucified
God&#8217;s Son!); never more of church-goers,
never less of saints.</p>

<p>It is prayer-force which makes saints.
Holy characters are formed by the power
of real praying. The more of true saints,
the more of praying; the more of praying,
the more of true saints.</p>

<p><i>I urge upon you communion with Christ, a growing
communion. There are curtains to be drawn
aside in Christ that we never saw, and new foldings
of love in him. I despair that I shall ever win to the
far end of that love, there are so many plies in it.
Therefore dig deep, and sweat and labor and take

<p><span class="smcap">God</span> has now, and has had, many of these
devoted, prayerful preachers&mdash;men in
whose lives prayer has been a mighty, controlling,
conspicuous force. The world has
felt their power, God has felt and honored
their power, God&#8217;s cause has moved mightily
and swiftly by their prayers, holiness has
shone out in their characters with a divine
effulgence.</p>

<p>God found one of the men he was looking
for in David Brainerd, whose work and
name have gone into history. He was no
ordinary man, but was capable of shining<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
in any company, the peer of the wise and
gifted ones, eminently suited to fill the most
attractive pulpits and to labor among the
most refined and the cultured, who were so
anxious to secure him for their pastor.
President Edwards bears testimony that he
was &#8220;a young man of distinguished talents,
had extraordinary knowledge of men and
things, had rare conversational powers, excelled
in his knowledge of theology, and
was truly, for one so young, an extraordinary
divine, and especially in all matters
relating to experimental religion. I never
knew his equal of his age and standing for
clear and accurate notions of the nature and
essence of true religion. His manner in
prayer was almost inimitable, such as I have
very rarely known equaled. His learning
was very considerable, and he had extraordinary
gifts for the pulpit.&#8221;</p>

<p>No sublimer story has been recorded in
earthly annals than that of David Brainerd;
no miracle attests with diviner force
the truth of Christianity than the life and
work of such a man. Alone in the savage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
wilds of America, struggling day and night
with a mortal disease, unschooled in the
care of souls, having access to the Indians
for a large portion of time only through
the bungling medium of a pagan interpreter,
with the Word of God in his heart and
in his hand, his soul fired with the divine
flame, a place and time to pour out his soul
to God in prayer, he fully established the
worship of God and secured all its gracious
results. The Indians were changed with a
great change from the lowest besotments
of an ignorant and debased heathenism to
pure, devout, intelligent Christians; all vice
reformed, the external duties of Christianity
at once embraced and acted on; family
prayer set up; the Sabbath instituted and
religiously observed; the internal graces of
religion exhibited with growing sweetness
and strength. The solution of these results
is found in David Brainerd himself, not in
the conditions or accidents but in the man
Brainerd. He was God&#8217;s man, for God
first and last and all the time. God could
flow unhindered through him. The omnipotence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
of grace was neither arrested nor
straightened by the conditions of his heart;
the whole channel was broadened and
cleaned out for God&#8217;s fullest and most powerful
passage, so that God with all his
mighty forces could come down on the
hopeless, savage wilderness, and transform
it into his blooming and fruitful garden;
for nothing is too hard for God to do if he
can get the right kind of a man to do it
with.</p>

<p>Brainerd lived the life of holiness and
prayer. His diary is full and monotonous
with the record of his seasons of fasting,
meditation, and retirement. The time he
spent in private prayer amounted to many
hours daily. &#8220;When I return home,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;and give myself to meditation,
prayer, and fasting, my soul longs for mortification,
self-denial, humility, and divorcement
from all things of the world.&#8221; &#8220;I
have nothing to do,&#8221; he said, &#8220;with earth,
but only to labor in it honestly for God. I
do not desire to live one minute for anything
which earth can afford.&#8221; After this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
high order did he pray: &#8220;Feeling somewhat
of the sweetness of communion with God
and the constraining force of his love, and
how admirably it captivates the soul and
makes all the desires and affections to center
in God, I set apart this day for secret
fasting and prayer, to entreat God to direct
and bless me with regard to the great work
which I have in view of preaching the gospel,
and that the Lord would return to me
and show me the light of his countenance.
I had little life and power in the forenoon.
Near the middle of the afternoon God enabled
me to wrestle ardently in intercession
for my absent friends, but just at night the
Lord visited me marvelously in prayer. I
think my soul was never in such agony before.
I felt no restraint, for the treasures
of divine grace were opened to me. I wrestled
for absent friends, for the ingathering
of souls, for multitudes of poor souls, and
for many that I thought were the children
of God, personally, in many distant places.
I was in such agony from sun half an hour
high till near dark that I was all over wet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
with sweat, but yet it seemed to me I had
done nothing. O, my dear Saviour did
sweat blood for poor souls! I longed for
more compassion toward them. I felt still
in a sweet frame, under a sense of divine
love and grace, and went to bed in such a
frame, with my heart set on God.&#8221; It was
prayer which gave to his life and ministry
their marvelous power.</p>

<p>The men of mighty prayer are men of
spiritual might. Prayers never die. Brainerd&#8217;s
whole life was a life of prayer. By
day and by night he prayed. Before preaching
and after preaching he prayed. Riding
through the interminable solitudes of the
forests he prayed. On his bed of straw he
prayed. Retiring to the dense and lonely
forests, he prayed. Hour by hour, day after
day, early morn and late at night, he was
praying and fasting, pouring out his soul,
interceding, communing with God. He was
with God mightily in prayer, and God was
with him mightily, and by it he being dead
yet speaketh and worketh, and will speak
and work till the end comes, and among the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
glorious ones of that glorious day he will
be with the first.</p>

<p>Jonathan Edwards says of him: &#8220;His
life shows the right way to success in the
works of the ministry. He sought it as the
soldier seeks victory in a siege or battle; or
as a man that runs a race for a great prize.
Animated with love to Christ and souls,
how did he labor? Always fervently. Not
only in word and doctrine, in public and in
private, but in prayers by day and night,
wrestling with God in secret and travailing
in birth with unutterable groans and agonies,
until Christ was formed in the hearts
of the people to whom he was sent. Like a
true son of Jacob, he persevered in wrestling
through all the darkness of the night,
until the breaking of the day!&#8221;</p>

<p><i>In the morning was more engaged in preparing
the head than the heart. This has been frequently my
error, and I have always felt the evil of it, especially
in prayer. Reform it, then, O Lord! Enlarge my
hearty and I shall preach.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Robert

<p><i>A sermon that has more head infused into it than
heart will not come home with efficacy to the hearers.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Richard

<p><span class="smcap">Prayer</span>, with its manifold and many-sided
forces, helps the mouth to utter the truth
in its fullness and freedom. The preacher
is to be prayed for, the preacher is made by
prayer. The preacher&#8217;s mouth is to be
prayed for; his mouth is to be opened and
filled by prayer. A holy mouth is made by
praying, by much praying; a brave mouth
is made by praying, by much praying. The
Church and the world, God and heaven,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
owe much to Paul&#8217;s mouth; Paul&#8217;s mouth
owed its power to prayer.</p>

<p>How manifold, illimitable, valuable, and
helpful prayer is to the preacher in so
many ways, at so many points, in every
way! One great value is, it helps his heart.</p>

<p>Praying makes the preacher a heart
preacher. Prayer puts the preacher&#8217;s heart
into the preacher&#8217;s sermon; prayer puts the
preacher&#8217;s sermon into the preacher&#8217;s heart.</p>

<p>The heart makes the preacher. Men of
great hearts are great preachers. Men of
bad hearts may do a measure of good, but
this is rare. The hireling and the stranger
may help the sheep at some points, but it
is the good shepherd with the good shepherd&#8217;s
heart who will bless the sheep and
answer the full measure of the shepherd&#8217;s
place.</p>

<p>We have emphasized sermon-preparation
until we have lost sight of the important
thing to be prepared&mdash;the heart. A prepared
heart is much better than a prepared
sermon. A prepared heart will make a
prepared sermon.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>Volumes have been written laying down
the mechanics and taste of sermon-making,
until we have become possessed with the
idea that this scaffolding is the building.
The young preacher has been taught to lay
out all his strength on the form, taste, and
beauty of his sermon as a mechanical and
intellectual product. We have thereby cultivated
a vicious taste among the people and
raised the clamor for talent instead of
grace, eloquence instead of piety, rhetoric
instead of revelation, reputation and brilliancy
instead of holiness. By it we have
lost the true idea of preaching, lost preaching
power, lost pungent conviction for sin,
lost the rich experience and elevated Christian
character, lost the authority over consciences
and lives which always results
from genuine preaching.</p>

<p>It would not do to say that preachers
study too much. Some of them do not
study at all; others do not study enough.
Numbers do not study the right way to
show themselves workmen approved of
God. But our great lack is not in head<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
culture, but in heart culture; not lack of
knowledge but lack of holiness is our sad
and telling defect&mdash;not that we know too
much, but that we do not meditate on God
and his word and watch and fast and pray
enough. The heart is the great hindrance
to our preaching. Words pregnant with
divine truth find in our hearts nonconductors;
arrested, they fall shorn and powerless.</p>

<p>Can ambition, that lusts after praise and
place, preach the gospel of Him who made
himself of no reputation and took on Him
the form of a servant? Can the proud,
the vain, the egotistical preach the gospel of
him who was meek and lowly? Can the
bad-tempered, passionate, selfish, hard,
worldly man preach the system which
teems with long-suffering, self-denial, tenderness,
which imperatively demands separation
from enmity and crucifixion to the
world? Can the hireling official, heartless,
perfunctory, preach the gospel which demands
the shepherd to give his life for the
sheep? Can the covetous man, who counts
salary and money, preach the gospel till he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
has gleaned his heart and can say in the
spirit of Christ and Paul in the words of
Wesley: &#8220;I count it dung and dross; I
trample it under my feet; I (yet not I, but
the grace of God in me) esteem it just as
the mire of the streets, I desire it not, I
seek it not?&#8221; God&#8217;s revelation does not
need the light of human genius, the polish
and strength of human culture, the brilliancy
of human thought, the force of human
brains to adorn or enforce it; but it
does demand the simplicity, the docility,
humility, and faith of a child&#8217;s heart.</p>

<p>It was this surrender and subordination
of intellect and genius to the divine and
spiritual forces which made Paul peerless
among the apostles. It was this which gave
Wesley his power and radicated his labors
in the history of humanity. This gave to
Loyola the strength to arrest the retreating
forces of Catholicism.</p>

<p>Our great need is heart-preparation.
Luther held it as an axiom: &#8220;He who has
prayed well has studied well.&#8221; We do not
say that men are not to think and use their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
intellects; but he will use his intellect best
who cultivates his heart most. We do not
say that preachers should not be students;
but we do say that their great study should
be the Bible, and he studies the Bible best
who has kept his heart with diligence. We
do not say that the preacher should not
know men, but he will be the greater adept
in human nature who has fathomed the
depths and intricacies of his own heart. We
do say that while the channel of preaching
is the mind, its fountain is the heart;
you may broaden and deepen the channel,
but if you do not look well to the purity
and depth of the fountain, you will have a
dry or polluted channel. We do say that
almost any man of common intelligence has
sense enough to preach the gospel, but very
few have grace enough to do so. We do
say that he who has struggled with his
own heart and conquered it; who has
taught it humility, faith, love, truth, mercy,
sympathy, courage; who can pour the rich
treasures of the heart thus trained, through
a manly intellect, all surcharged with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
power of the gospel on the consciences of
his hearers&mdash;such a one will be the truest,
most successful preacher in the esteem of
his Lord.</p>

<p><i>Study not to be a fine preacher. Jerichos are blown
down with rams&#8217; horns. Look simply unto Jesus for
preaching food; and what is wanted will be given,
and what is given will be blessed, whether it be a barley
grain or a wheaten loaf, a crust or a crumb.
Your mouth will be a flowing stream or a fountain
sealed, according as your heart is. Avoid all controversy
in preaching, talking, or writing; preach nothing
down but the devil, and nothing up but Jesus
Christ.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Berridge.</span></p></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> heart is the saviour of the world.
Heads do not save. Genius, brains, brilliancy,
strength, natural gifts do not save.
The gospel flows through hearts. All the
mightiest forces are heart forces. All the
sweetest and loveliest graces are heart
graces. Great hearts make great characters;
great hearts make divine characters.
God is love. There is nothing greater than
love, nothing greater than God. Hearts
make heaven; heaven is love. There is nothing
higher, nothing sweeter, than heaven. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
is the heart and not the head which makes
God&#8217;s great preachers. The heart counts
much every way in religion. The heart
must speak from the pulpit. The heart
must hear in the pew. In fact, we serve
God with our hearts. Head homage does
not pass current in heaven.</p>

<p>We believe that one of the serious and
most popular errors of the modern pulpit
is the putting of more thought than prayer,
of more head than of heart in its sermons.
Big hearts make big preachers; good hearts
make good preachers. A theological school
to enlarge and cultivate the heart is the
golden desideratum of the gospel. The
pastor binds his people to him and rules
his people by his heart. They may admire
his gifts, they may be proud of his
ability, they may be affected for the time
by his sermons; but the stronghold of
his power is his heart. His scepter is love.
The throne of his power is his heart.</p>

<p>The good shepherd gives his life for the
sheep. Heads never make martyrs. It is
the heart which surrenders the life to love<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
and fidelity. It takes great courage to be
a faithful pastor, but the heart alone can
supply this courage. Gifts and genius may
be brave, but it is the gifts and genius of
the heart and not of the head.</p>

<p>It is easier to fill the head than it is to
prepare the heart. It is easier to make a
brain sermon than a heart sermon. It was
heart that drew the Son of God from heaven.
It is heart that will draw men to heaven.
Men of heart is what the world needs
to sympathize with its woe, to kiss away
its sorrows, to compassionate its misery,
and to alleviate its pain. Christ was eminently
the man of sorrows, because he was
pre&euml;minently the man of heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me thy heart,&#8221; is God&#8217;s requisition
of men. &#8220;Give me thy heart!&#8221; is man&#8217;s
demand of man.</p>

<p>A professional ministry is a heartless
ministry. When salary plays a great part
in the ministry, the heart plays little part.
We may make preaching our business, and
not put our hearts in the business. He who
puts self to the front in his preaching puts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
heart to the rear. He who does not sow
with his heart in his study will never reap
a harvest for God. The closet is the heart&#8217;s
study. We will learn more about how to
preach and what to preach there than we
can learn in our libraries. &#8220;Jesus wept&#8221; is
the shortest and biggest verse in the Bible.
It is he who goes forth <i>weeping</i> (not
preaching great sermons), bearing precious
seed, who shall come again rejoicing, bringing
his sheaves with him.</p>

<p>Praying gives sense, brings wisdom,
broadens and strengthens the mind. The
closet is a perfect school-teacher and school-house
for the preacher. Thought is not
only brightened and clarified in prayer, but
thought is born in prayer. We can learn
more in an hour praying, when praying indeed,
than from many hours in the study.
Books are in the closet which can be found
and read nowhere else. Revelations are
made in the closet which are made nowhere
else.</p>

<p><i>One bright benison which private prayer brings
down upon the ministry is an indescribable and inimitable
something&mdash;an unction from the Holy One....
If the anointing which we bear come not from
the Lord of hosts, we are deceivers, since only in prayer
can we obtain it. Let us continue instant, constant,
fervent in supplication. Let your fleece lie on the
thrashing floor of supplication till it is wet with the

<p><span class="smcap">Alexander Knox</span>, a Christian philosopher
of the days of Wesley, not an adherent
but a strong personal friend of Wesley,
and with much spiritual sympathy with the
Wesleyan movement, writes: &#8220;It is strange
and lamentable, but I verily believe the
fact to be that except among Methodists
and Methodistical clergyman, there is not
much interesting preaching in England.
The clergy, too generally, have absolutely
lost the art. There is, I conceive, in the
great laws of the moral world a kind of secret
understanding like the affinities in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
chemistry, between rightly promulgated
religious truth and the deepest feelings of
the human mind. Where the one is duly
exhibited, the other will respond. Did not
our hearts burn within us?&mdash;but to this
devout feeling is indispensable in the speaker.
Now, I am obliged to state from my
own observation that this <i>onction</i>, as the
French not unfitly term it, is beyond all
comparison more likely to be found in England
in a Methodist conventicle than in a
parish Church. This, and this alone, seems
really to be that which fills the Methodist
houses and thins the Churches. I am, I verily
think, no enthusiast; I am a most sincere
and cordial churchman, a humble disciple
of the School of Hale and Boyle, of
Burnet and Leighton. Now I must aver
that when I was in this country, two years
ago, I did not hear a single preacher who
taught me like my own great masters but
such as are deemed Methodistical. And I
now despair of getting an atom of heart-instruction
from any other quarter. The
Methodist preachers (however I may not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
always approve of all their expressions) do
most assuredly diffuse this true religion
and undefiled. I felt real pleasure last
Sunday. I can bear witness that the
preacher did at once speak the words of
truth and soberness. There was no eloquence&mdash;the
honest man never dreamed of
such a thing&mdash;but there was far better: a
cordial communication of vitalized truth. I
say vitalized because what he declared to
others it was impossible not to feel he lived
on himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>This unction is the art of preaching. The
preacher who never had this unction never
had the art of preaching. The preacher
who has lost this unction has lost the art of
preaching. Whatever other arts he may
have and retain&mdash;the art of sermon-making,
the art of eloquence, the art of great,
clear thinking, the art of pleasing an audience&mdash;he
has lost the divine art of preaching.
This unction makes God&#8217;s truth powerful
and interesting, draws and attracts,
edifies, convicts, saves.</p>

<p>This unction vitalizes God&#8217;s revealed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
truth, makes it living and life-giving. Even
God&#8217;s truth spoken without this unction is
light, dead, and deadening. Though
abounding in truth, though weighty with
thought, though sparkling with rhetoric,
though pointed by logic, though powerful
by earnestness, without this divine unction
it issues in death and not in life. Mr.
Spurgeon says: &#8220;I wonder how long we
might beat our brains before we could
plainly put into word what is meant by
preaching with unction. Yet he who
preaches knows its presence, and he who
hears soon detects its absence. Samaria, in
famine, typifies a discourse without it. Jerusalem,
with her feast of fat things, full
of marrow, may represent a sermon enriched
with it. Every one knows what the
freshness of the morning is when orient
pearls abound on every blade of grass, but
who can describe it, much less produce it of
itself? Such is the mystery of spiritual
anointing. We know, but we cannot tell to
others what it is. It is as easy as it is foolish,
to counterfeit it. Unction is a thing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
which you cannot manufacture, and its
counterfeits are worse than worthless. Yet
it is, in itself, priceless, and beyond measure
needful if you would edify believers and
bring sinners to Christ.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Unction</span> is that indefinable, indescribable
something which an old, renowned
Scotch preacher describes thus: &#8220;There is
sometimes somewhat in preaching that
cannot be ascribed either to matter or expression,
and cannot be described what it
is, or from whence it cometh, but with a
sweet violence it pierceth into the heart
and affections and comes immediately
from the Lord; but if there be any way
to obtain such a thing, it is by the heavenly
disposition of the speaker.&#8221;</p>

<p>We call it unction. It is this unction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
which makes the word of God &#8220;quick and
powerful, and sharper than any two-edged
sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder
of soul and spirit, and of the joints and
marrow, and a discerner of the thoughts
and intents of the heart.&#8221; It is this unction
which gives the words of the preacher
such point, sharpness, and power, and
which creates such friction and stir in many
a dead congregation. The same truths
have been told in the strictness of the letter,
smooth as human oil could make them;
but no signs of life, not a pulse throb; all
as peaceful as the grave and as dead. The
same preacher in the meanwhile receives a
baptism of this unction, the divine inflatus
is on him, the letter of the Word has been
embellished and fired by this mysterious
power, and the throbbings of life begin&mdash;life
which receives or life which resists.
The unction pervades and convicts the conscience
and breaks the heart.</p>

<p>This divine unction is the feature which
separates and distinguishes true gospel
preaching from all other methods of presenting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
the truth, and which creates a wide
spiritual chasm between the preacher who
has it and the one who has it not. It backs
and impregns revealed truth with all the
energy of God. Unction is simply putting
God in his own word and on his own
preacher. By mighty and great prayerfulness
and by continual prayerfulness, it is
all potential and personal to the preacher; it
inspires and clarifies his intellect, gives insight
and grasp and projecting power; it
gives to the preacher heart power, which is
greater than head power; and tenderness,
purity, force flow from the heart by it.
Enlargement, freedom, fullness of thought,
directness and simplicity of utterance are
the fruits of this unction.</p>

<p>Often earnestness is mistaken for this
unction. He who has the divine unction
will be earnest in the very spiritual nature
of things, but there may be a vast deal of
earnestness without the least mixture of
unction.</p>

<p>Earnestness and unction look alike from
some points of view. Earnestness may be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
readily and without detection substituted
or mistaken for unction. It requires a spiritual
eye and a spiritual taste to discriminate.</p>

<p>Earnestness may be sincere, serious, ardent,
and persevering. It goes at a thing
with good will, pursues it with perseverance,
and urges it with ardor; puts
force in it. But all these forces do
not rise higher than the mere human.
The <i>man</i> is in it&mdash;the whole man, with
all that he has of will and heart, of
brain and genius, of planning and working
and talking. He has set himself to some
purpose which has mastered him, and he
pursues to master it. There may be none
of God in it. There may be little of God
in it, because there is so much of the man
in it. He may present pleas in advocacy of
his earnest purpose which please or touch
and move or overwhelm with conviction of
their importance; and in all this earnestness
may move along earthly ways, being
propelled by human forces only, its altar
made by earthly hands and its fire kindled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
by earthly flames. It is said of a rather famous
preacher of gifts, whose construction
of Scripture was to his fancy or purpose,
that he &#8220;grew very eloquent over his own
exegesis.&#8221; So men grow exceeding earnest
over their own plans or movements. Earnestness
may be selfishness simulated.</p>

<p>What of unction? It is the indefinable in
preaching which makes it preaching. It is
that which distinguishes and separates
preaching from all mere human addresses.
It is the divine in preaching. It makes the
preaching sharp to those who need sharpness.
It distills as the dew to those who
need to be refreshed. It is well described
as:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent5">&#8220;a two-edged sword</div>
<div class="indent">Of heavenly temper keen,</div>
<div class="verse">And double were the wounds it made</div>
<div class="indent">Where&#8217;er it glanced between.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8217;Twas death to sin; &#8217;twas life</div>
<div class="indent">To all who mourned for sin.</div>
<div class="verse">It kindled and it silenced strife,</div>
<div class="indent">Made war and peace within.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>This unction comes to the preacher not in
the study but in the closet. It is heaven&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
distillation in answer to prayer. It is the
sweetest exhalation of the Holy Spirit. It
impregnates, suffuses, softens, percolates,
cuts, and soothes. It carries the Word like
dynamite, like salt, like sugar; makes the
Word a soother, an arraigner, a revealer, a
searcher; makes the hearer a culprit or a
saint, makes him weep like a child and live
like a giant; opens his heart and his purse
as gently, yet as strongly as the spring
opens the leaves. This unction is not the
gift of genius. It is not found in the halls
of learning. No eloquence can woo it. No
industry can win it. No prelatical hands
can confer it. It is the gift of God&mdash;the
signet set to his own messengers. It is
heaven&#8217;s knighthood given to the chosen
true and brave ones who have sought this
anointed honor through many an hour of
tearful, wrestling prayer.</p>

<p>Earnestness is good and impressive; genius
is gifted and great. Thought kindles
and inspires, but it takes a diviner endowment,
a more powerful energy than earnestness

chains of sin, to win estranged and depraved
hearts to God, to repair the breaches
and restore the Church to her old ways of
purity and power. Nothing but this holy
unction can do this.</p>

<p><i>All the minister&#8217;s efforts will be vanity or worse than
vanity if he have not unction. Unction must come
down from heaven and spread a savor and feeling and
relish over his ministry; and among the other means
of qualifying himself for his office, the Bible must hold
the first place, and the last also must be given to the
Word of God and prayer.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Richard Cecil.</span></p></div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the Christian system unction is the
anointing of the Holy Ghost, separating
unto God&#8217;s work and qualifying for it.
This unction is the one divine enablement
by which the preacher accomplishes the peculiar
and saving ends of preaching. Without
this unction there are no true spiritual
results accomplished; the results and forces
in preaching do not rise above the results
of unsanctified speech. Without unction
the former is as potent as the pulpit.</p>

<p>This divine unction on the preacher generates
through the Word of God the spiritual
results that flow from the gospel; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
without this unction, these results are not
secured. Many pleasant impressions may
be made, but these all fall far below the
ends of gospel preaching. This unction
may be simulated. There are many things
that look like it, there are many results that
resemble its effects; but they are foreign
to its results and to its nature. The fervor
or softness excited by a pathetic or emotional
sermon may look like the movements
of the divine unction, but they have no pungent,
penetrating, heart-breaking force. No
heart-healing balm is there in these surface,
sympathetic, emotional movements; they
are not radical, neither sin-searching nor
sin-curing.</p>

<p>This divine unction is the one distinguishing
feature that separates true gospel
preaching from all other methods of presenting
truth. It backs and interpenetrates
the revealed truth with all the force of God.
It illumines the Word and broadens and
enrichens the intellect and empowers it to
grasp and apprehend the Word. It qualifies
the preacher&#8217;s heart, and brings it to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
that condition of tenderness, of purity, of
force and light that are necessary to secure
the highest results. This unction gives to
the preacher liberty and enlargement of
thought and soul&mdash;a freedom, fullness, and
directness of utterance that can be secured
by no other process.</p>

<p>Without this unction on the preacher the
gospel has no more power to propagate
itself than any other system of truth. This
is the seal of its divinity. Unction in the
preacher puts God in the gospel. Without
the unction, God is absent, and the gospel
is left to the low and unsatisfactory forces
that the ingenuity, interest, or talents of
men can devise to enforce and project its
doctrines.</p>

<p>It is in this element that the pulpit oftener
fails than in any other element. Just at
this all-important point it lapses. Learning
it may have, brilliancy and eloquence may
delight and charm, sensation or less offensive
methods may bring the populace in
crowds, mental power may impress and enforce
truth with all its resources; but without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
this unction, each and all these will be
but as the fretful assault of the waters on
a Gibraltar. Spray and foam may cover
and spangle; but the rocks are there still,
unimpressed and unimpressible. The human
heart can no more be swept of its hardness
and sin by these human forces than
these rocks can be swept away by the
ocean&#8217;s ceaseless flow.</p>

<p>This unction is the consecration force,
and its presence the continuous test of that
consecration. It is this divine anointing
on the preacher that secures his consecration
to God and his work. Other forces
and motives may call him to the work, but
this only is consecration. A separation to
God&#8217;s work by the power of the Holy Spirit
is the only consecration recognized by God
as legitimate.</p>

<p>The unction, the divine unction, this
heavenly anointing, is what the pulpit needs
and must have. This divine and heavenly
oil put on it by the imposition of God&#8217;s
hand must soften and lubricate the whole
man&mdash;heart, head, spirit&mdash;until it separates<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
him with a mighty separation from all
earthly, secular, worldly, selfish motives
and aims, separating him to everything that
is pure and Godlike.</p>

<p>It is the presence of this unction on the
preacher that creates the stir and friction
in many a congregation. The same truths
have been told in the strictness of the letter,
but no ruffle has been seen, no pain or
pulsation felt. All is quiet as a graveyard.
Another preacher comes, and this mysterious
influence is on him; the letter of the
Word has been fired by the Spirit, the
throes of a mighty movement are felt, it is
the unction that pervades and stirs the conscience
and breaks the heart. Unctionless
preaching makes everything hard, dry, acrid,
dead.</p>

<p>This unction is not a memory or an era
of the past only; it is a present, realized,
conscious fact. It belongs to the experience
of the man as well as to his preaching.
It is that which transforms him into the
image of his divine Master, as well as that
by which he declares the truths of Christ<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
with power. It is so much the power in
the ministry as to make all else seem feeble
and vain without it, and by its presence to
atone for the absence of all other and feebler
forces.</p>

<p>This unction is not an inalienable gift.
It is a conditional gift, and its presence is
perpetuated and increased by the same
process by which it was at first secured; by
unceasing prayer to God, by impassioned
desires after God, by estimating it, by seeking
it with tireless ardor, by deeming all
else loss and failure without it.</p>

<p>How and whence comes this unction?
Direct from God in answer to prayer.
Praying hearts only are the hearts filled
with this holy oil; praying lips only are
anointed with this divine unction.</p>

<p>Prayer, much prayer, is the price of
preaching unction; prayer, much prayer, is
the one, sole condition of keeping this unction.
Without unceasing prayer the unction
never comes to the preacher. Without
perseverance in prayer, the unction,
like the manna overkept, breeds worms.</p>

<p><i>Give me one hundred preachers who fear nothing
but sin and desire nothing but God, and I care not a
straw whether they be clergymen or laymen; such alone
will shake the gates of hell and set up the kingdom of
heaven on earth. God does nothing but in answer to
prayer.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">John Wesley.</span></p></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> apostles knew the necessity and
worth of prayer to their ministry. They
knew that their high commission as apostles,
instead of relieving them from the necessity
of prayer, committed them to it by
a more urgent need; so that they were exceedingly
jealous else some other important
work should exhaust their time and prevent
their praying as they ought; so they appointed
laymen to look after the delicate
and engrossing duties of ministering to the
poor, that they (the apostles) might, unhindered,
&#8220;give themselves continually to
prayer and to the ministry of the word.&#8221;
Prayer is put first, and their relation to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
prayer is put most strongly&mdash;&#8220;give themselves
to it,&#8221; making a business of it, surrendering
themselves to praying, putting
fervor, urgency, perseverance, and time in
it.</p>

<p>How holy, apostolic men devoted themselves
to this divine work of prayer!
&#8220;Night and day praying exceedingly,&#8221; says
Paul. &#8220;We will give ourselves continually
to prayer&#8221; is the consensus of apostolic devotement.
How these New Testament
preachers laid themselves out in prayer for
God&#8217;s people! How they put God in full
force into their Churches by their praying!
These holy apostles did not vainly fancy
that they had met their high and solemn
duties by delivering faithfully God&#8217;s word,
but their preaching was made to stick and
tell by the ardor and insistence of their
praying. Apostolic praying was as taxing,
toilsome, and imperative as apostolic
preaching. They prayed mightily day and
night to bring their people to the highest
regions of faith and holiness. They prayed
mightier still to hold them to this high<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
spiritual altitude. The preacher who has
never learned in the school of Christ the
high and divine art of intercession for his
people will never learn the art of preaching,
though homiletics be poured into him
by the ton, and though he be the most gifted
genius in sermon-making and sermon-delivery.</p>

<p>The prayers of apostolic, saintly leaders
do much in making saints of those who
are not apostles. If the Church leaders in
after years had been as particular and fervent
in praying for their people as the apostles
were, the sad, dark times of worldliness
and apostasy had not marred the history
and eclipsed the glory and arrested the advance
of the Church. Apostolic praying
makes apostolic saints and keeps apostolic
times of purity and power in the Church.</p>

<p>What loftiness of soul, what purity and
elevation of motive, what unselfishness,
what self-sacrifice, what exhaustive toil,
what ardor of spirit, what divine tact
are requisite to be an intercessor for men!</p>

<p>The preacher is to lay himself out in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
prayer for his people; not that they might
be saved, simply, but that they be mightily
saved. The apostles laid themselves out in
prayer that their saints might be perfect;
not that they should have a little relish for
the things of God, but that they &#8220;might be
filled with all the fullness of God.&#8221; Paul
did not rely on his apostolic preaching to
secure this end, but &#8220;for this cause he
bowed his knees to the Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ.&#8221; Paul&#8217;s praying carried
Paul&#8217;s converts farther along the highway
of sainthood than Paul&#8217;s preaching did.
Epaphras did as much or more by prayer
for the Colossian saints than by his preaching.
He labored fervently always in
prayer for them that &#8220;they might stand perfect
and complete in all the will of God.&#8221;</p>

<p>Preachers are pre&euml;minently God&#8217;s leaders.
They are primarily responsible for the
condition of the Church. They shape its
character, give tone and direction to its
life.</p>

<p>Much every way depends on these leaders.
They shape the times and the institutions.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
The Church is divine, the treasure it
incases is heavenly, but it bears the imprint
of the human. The treasure is in earthen
vessels, and it smacks of the vessel. The
Church of God makes, or is made by, its
leaders. Whether it makes them or is made
by them, it will be what its leaders are;
spiritual if they are so, secular if they are,
conglomerate if its leaders are. Israel&#8217;s kings
gave character to Israel&#8217;s piety. A Church
rarely revolts against or rises above the religion
of its leaders. Strongly spiritual
leaders; men of holy might, at the lead,
are tokens of God&#8217;s favor; disaster and
weakness follow the wake of feeble or
worldly leaders. Israel had fallen low
when God gave children to be their princes
and babes to rule over them. No happy
state is predicted by the prophets when children
oppress God&#8217;s Israel and women rule
over them. Times of spiritual leadership
are times of great spiritual prosperity to the
Church.</p>

<p>Prayer is one of the eminent characteristics
of strong spiritual leadership. Men of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
mighty prayer are men of might and mold
things. Their power with God has the
conquering tread.</p>

<p>How can a man preach who does not get
his message fresh from God in the closet?
How can he preach without having his
faith quickened, his vision cleared, and his
heart warmed by his closeting with God?
Alas, for the pulpit lips which are untouched
by this closet flame. Dry and unctionless
they will ever be, and truths divine
will never come with power from such
lips. As far as the real interests of religion
are concerned, a pulpit without a
closet will always be a barren thing.</p>

<p>A preacher may preach in an official, entertaining,
or learned way without prayer,
but between this kind of preaching and
sowing God&#8217;s precious seed with holy hands
and prayerful, weeping hearts there is an
immeasurable distance.</p>

<p>A prayerless ministry is the undertaker
for all God&#8217;s truth and for God&#8217;s Church.
He may have the most costly casket and
the most beautiful flowers, but it is a funeral,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
notwithstanding the charmful array. A
prayerless Christian will never learn God&#8217;s
truth; a prayerless ministry will never be
able to teach God&#8217;s truth. Ages of millennial
glory have been lost by a prayerless
Church. The coming of our Lord has
been postponed indefinitely by a prayerless
Church. Hell has enlarged herself and
filled her dire caves in the presence of the
dead service of a prayerless Church.</p>

<p>The best, the greatest offering is an
offering of prayer. If the preachers of
the twentieth century will learn well the
lesson of prayer, and use fully the power
of prayer, the millennium will come to its
noon ere the century closes. &#8220;Pray without
ceasing&#8221; is the trumpet call to the
preachers of the twentieth century. If the
twentieth century will get their texts, their
thoughts, their words, their sermons in their
closets, the next century will find a new
heaven and a new earth. The old sin-stained
and sin-eclipsed heaven and earth
will pass away under the power of a praying
ministry.</p>

<p><i>If some Christians that have been complaining of
their ministers had said and acted less before men and
had applied themselves with all their might to cry to
God for their ministers&mdash;had, as it were, risen and
stormed heaven with their humble, fervent, and incessant
prayers for them&mdash;they would have been much
more in the way of success.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Jonathan Edwards.</span></p></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Somehow</span> the practice of praying in particular
for the preacher has fallen into disuse
or become discounted. Occasionally
have we heard the practice arraigned as a
disparagement of the ministry, being a public
declaration by those who do it of the inefficiency
of the ministry. It offends the
pride of learning and self-sufficiency, perhaps,
and these ought to be offended and
rebuked in a ministry that is so derelict as
to allow them to exist.</p>

<p>Prayer, to the preacher, is not simply
the duty of his profession, a privilege, but
it is a necessity. Air is not more necessary
to the lungs than prayer is to the preacher.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
It is absolutely necessary for the preacher
to pray. It is an absolute necessity that the
preacher be prayed for. These two propositions
are wedded into a union which ought
never to know any divorce: <i>the preacher
must pray; the preacher must be prayed</i>
for. It will take all the praying he can do,
and all the praying he can get done, to meet
the fearful responsibilities and gain the
largest, truest success in his great work.
The true preacher, next to the cultivation of
the spirit and fact of prayer in himself, in
their intensest form, covets with a great
covetousness the prayers of God&#8217;s people.</p>

<p>The holier a man is, the more does he estimate
prayer; the clearer does he see that
God gives himself to the praying ones, and
that the measure of God&#8217;s revelation to the
soul is the measure of the soul&#8217;s longing,
importunate prayer for God. Salvation
never finds its way to a prayerless heart.
The Holy Spirit never abides in a prayerless
spirit. Preaching never edifies a
prayerless soul. Christ knows nothing of
prayerless Christians. The gospel cannot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
be projected by a prayerless preacher.
Gifts, talents, education, eloquence, God&#8217;s
call, cannot abate the demand of prayer, but
only intensify the necessity for the preacher
to pray and to be prayed for. The more
the preacher&#8217;s eyes are opened to the nature,
responsibility, and difficulties in his
work, the more will he see, and if he be a
true preacher the more will he feel, the necessity
of prayer; not only the increasing
demand to pray himself, but to call on others
to help him by their prayers.</p>

<p>Paul is an illustration of this. If any
man could project the gospel by dint of personal
force, by brain power, by culture, by
personal grace, by God&#8217;s apostolic commission,
God&#8217;s extraordinary call, that man
was Paul. That the preacher must be a
man given to prayer, Paul is an eminent example.
That the true apostolic preacher
must have the prayers of other good people
to give to his ministry its full quota of
success, Paul is a pre&euml;minent example. He
asks, he covets, he pleads in an impassioned
way for the help of all God&#8217;s saints. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
knew that in the spiritual realm, as elsewhere,
in union there is strength; that the
concentration and aggregation of faith, desire,
and prayer increased the volume of
spiritual force until it became overwhelming
and irresistible in its power. Units
of prayer combined, like drops of water,
make an ocean which defies resistance. So
Paul, with his clear and full apprehension
of spiritual dynamics, determined to make
his ministry as impressive, as eternal, as irresistible
as the ocean, by gathering all the
scattered units of prayer and precipitating
them on his ministry. May not the solution
of Paul&#8217;s pre&euml;minence in labors and
results, and impress on the Church and the
world, be found in this fact that he was
able to center on himself and his ministry
more of prayer than others? To his brethren
at Rome he wrote: &#8220;Now I beseech
you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ&#8217;s
sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye
strive together with me in prayers to God
for me.&#8221; To the Ephesians he says: &#8220;Praying
always with all prayer and supplication<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with
all perseverance and supplication for all
saints; and for me, that utterance may be
given unto me, that I may open my mouth
boldly, to make known the mystery of the
gospel.&#8221; To the Colossians he emphasizes:
&#8220;Withal praying also for us, that God would
open unto us a door of utterance, to speak
the mystery of Christ, for which I am also
in bonds: that I may make it manifest as I
ought to speak.&#8221; To the Thessalonians he
says sharply, strongly: &#8220;Brethren, pray for
us.&#8221; Paul calls on the Corinthian Church
to help him: &#8220;Ye also helping together by
prayer for us.&#8221; This was to be part of
their work. They were to lay to the helping
hand of prayer. He in an additional
and closing charge to the Thessalonian
Church about the importance and necessity
of their prayers says: &#8220;Finally, brethren,
pray for us, that the word of the Lord may
have free course, and be glorified, even as
it is with you: and that we may be delivered
from unreasonable and wicked men.&#8221;
He impresses the Philippians that all his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
trials and opposition can be made subservient
to the spread of the gospel by the efficiency
of their prayers for him. Philemon
was to prepare a lodging for him, for
through Philemon&#8217;s prayer Paul was to be
his guest.</p>

<p>Paul&#8217;s attitude on this question illustrates
his humility and his deep insight into the
spiritual forces which project the gospel.
More than this, it teaches a lesson for all
times, that if Paul was so dependent on
the prayers of God&#8217;s saints to give his
ministry success, how much greater the necessity
that the prayers of God&#8217;s saints be
centered on the ministry of to-day!</p>

<p>Paul did not feel that this urgent plea
for prayer was to lower his dignity, lessen
his influence, or depreciate his piety. What
if it did? Let dignity go, let influence be
destroyed, let his reputation be marred&mdash;he
must have their prayers. Called, commissioned,
chief of the Apostles as he was,
all his equipment was imperfect without the
prayers of his people. He wrote letters everywhere,
urging them to pray for him.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
Do you pray for your preacher? Do you
pray for him in secret? Public prayers are
of little worth unless they are founded on
or followed up by private praying. The
praying ones are to the preacher as Aaron
and Hur were to Moses. They hold up his
hands and decide the issue that is so fiercely
raging around them.</p>

<p>The plea and purpose of the apostles
were to put the Church to praying. They
did not ignore the grace of cheerful giving.
They were not ignorant of the place
which religious activity and work occupied
in the spiritual life; but not one nor all of
these, in apostolic estimate or urgency,
could at all compare in necessity and importance
with prayer. The most sacred
and urgent pleas were used, the most fervid
exhortations, the most comprehensive and
arousing words were uttered to enforce the
all-important obligation and necessity of
prayer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put the saints everywhere to praying&#8221;
is the burden of the apostolic effort and the
keynote of apostolic success. Jesus Christ<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
had striven to do this in the days of his
personal ministry. As he was moved by
infinite compassion at the ripened fields of
earth perishing for lack of laborers&mdash;and
pausing in his own praying&mdash;he tries to
awaken the stupid sensibilities of his disciples
to the duty of prayer as he charges
them, &#8220;Pray ye the Lord of the harvest that
he will send forth laborers into his harvest.&#8221;
&#8220;And he spake a parable unto them
to this end, that men ought always to pray
and not to faint.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>This perpetual hurry of business and company ruins
me in soul if not in body. More solitude and earlier
hours! I suspect I have been allotting habitually
too little time to religious exercises, as private devotion
and religious meditation, Scripture-reading, etc.
Hence I am lean and cold and hard. I had better allot
two hours or an hour and a half daily. I have been
keeping too late hours, and hence have had but a hurried
half hour in a morning to myself. Surely the
experience of all good men confirms the proposition that
without a due measure of private devotions the soul
will grow lean. But all may be done through prayer&mdash;almighty
prayer, I am ready to say&mdash;and why not?
For that it is almighty is only through the gracious
ordination of the God of love and truth. O then, pray,
pray, pray!</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">William Wilberforce.</span></p></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> devotions are not measured by the
clock, but time is of their essence. The
ability to wait and stay and press belongs
essentially to our intercourse with God.
Hurry, everywhere unseeming and damaging,
is so to an alarming extent in the
great business of communion with God.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
Short devotions are the bane of deep piety.
Calmness, grasp, strength, are never the
companions of hurry. Short devotions deplete
spiritual vigor, arrest spiritual progress,
sap spiritual foundations, blight the
root and bloom of spiritual life. They are
the prolific source of backsliding, the sure
indication of a superficial piety; they deceive,
blight, rot the seed, and impoverish
the soil.</p>

<p>It is true that Bible prayers in word and
print are short, but the praying men of the
Bible were with God through many a sweet
and holy wrestling hour. They won by
few words but long waiting. The prayers
Moses records may be short, but Moses
prayed to God with fastings and mighty
cryings forty days and nights.</p>

<p>The statement of Elijah&#8217;s praying may be
condensed to a few brief paragraphs, but
doubtless Elijah, who when &#8220;praying he
prayed,&#8221; spent many hours of fiery struggle
and lofty intercourse with God before
he could, with assured boldness, say to
Ahab, &#8220;There shall not be dew nor rain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
these years, but according to my word.&#8221;
The verbal brief of Paul&#8217;s prayers is short,
but Paul &#8220;prayed night and day exceedingly.&#8221;
The &#8220;Lord&#8217;s Prayer&#8221; is a divine epitome
for infant lips, but the man Christ
Jesus prayed many an all-night ere his work
was done; and his all-night and long-sustained
devotions gave to his work its finish
and perfection, and to his character the
fullness and glory of its divinity.</p>

<p>Spiritual work is taxing work, and men
are loath to do it. Praying, true praying,
costs an outlay of serious attention and of
time, which flesh and blood do not relish.
Few persons are made of such strong fiber
that they will make a costly outlay when
surface work will pass as well in the market.
We can habituate ourselves to our beggarly
praying until it looks well to us, at
least it keeps up a decent form and quiets
conscience&mdash;the deadliest of opiates! We
can slight our praying, and not realize the
peril till the foundations are gone. Hurried
devotions make weak faith, feeble convictions,
questionable piety. To be little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
with God is to be little for God. To cut
short the praying makes the whole religious
character short, scrimp, niggardly, and
slovenly.</p>

<p>It takes good time for the full flow of
God into the spirit. Short devotions cut
the pipe of God&#8217;s full flow. It takes time
in the secret places to get the full revelation
of God. Little time and hurry mar the
picture.</p>

<p>Henry Martyn laments that &#8220;want of
private devotional reading and shortness of
prayer through incessant sermon-making
had produced much strangeness between
God and his soul.&#8221; He judged that he had
dedicated too much time to <i>public</i> ministrations
and too little to <i>private</i> communion
with God. He was much impressed to set
apart times for fasting and to devote times
for solemn prayer. Resulting from this he
records: &#8220;Was assisted this morning to
pray for two hours.&#8221; Said William Wilberforce,
the peer of kings: &#8220;I must secure
more time for private devotions. I have
been living far too public for me. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
shortening of private devotions starves the
soul; it grows lean and faint. I have been
keeping too late hours.&#8221; Of a failure in
Parliament he says: &#8220;Let me record my
grief and shame, and all, probably, from
private devotions having been contracted,
and so God let me stumble.&#8221; More solitude
and earlier hours was his remedy.</p>

<p>More time and early hours for prayer
would act like magic to revive and invigorate
many a decayed spiritual life. More
time and early hours for prayer would be
manifest in holy living. A holy life would
not be so rare or so difficult a thing if our
devotions were not so short and hurried.
A Christly temper in its sweet and passionless
fragrance would not be so alien
and hopeless a heritage if our closet stay
were lengthened and intensified. We live
shabbily because we pray meanly. Plenty
of time to feast in our closets will bring
marrow and fatness to our lives. Our ability
to stay with God in our closet measures
our ability to stay with God out of the
closet. Hasty closet visits are deceptive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>,
defaulting. We are not only deluded by
them, but we are losers by them in many
ways and in many rich legacies. Tarrying
in the closet instructs and wins. We are
taught by it, and the greatest victories are
often the results of great waiting&mdash;waiting
till words and plans are exhausted, and silent
and patient waiting gains the crown.
Jesus Christ asks with an affronted emphasis,
&#8220;Shall not God avenge his own elect
which cry day and night unto him?&#8221;</p>

<p>To pray is the greatest thing we can do:
and to do it well there must be calmness,
time, and deliberation; otherwise it is degraded
into the littlest and meanest of
things. True praying has the largest results
for good; and poor praying, the least.
We cannot do too much of real praying;
we cannot do too little of the sham. We
must learn anew the worth of prayer, enter
anew the school of prayer. There is
nothing which it takes more time to learn.
And if we would learn the wondrous art,
we must not give a fragment here and
there&mdash;&#8220;A little talk with Jesus,&#8221; as the tiny<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
saintlets sing&mdash;but we must demand and
hold with iron grasp the best hours of the
day for God and prayer, or there will be
no praying worth the name.</p>

<p>This, however, is not a day of prayer.
Few men there are who pray. Prayer is
defamed by preacher and priest. In these
days of hurry and bustle, of electricity and
steam, men will not take time to pray.
Preachers there are who &#8220;say prayers&#8221; as
a part of their programme, on regular or
state occasions; but who &#8220;stirs himself up
to take hold upon God?&#8221; Who prays as
Jacob prayed&mdash;till he is crowned as a prevailing,
princely intercessor? Who prays
as Elijah prayed&mdash;till all the locked-up
forces of nature were unsealed and a famine-stricken
land bloomed as the garden of
God? Who prayed as Jesus Christ prayed
as out upon the mountain he &#8220;continued all
night in prayer to God?&#8221; The apostles
&#8220;gave themselves to prayer&#8221;&mdash;the most difficult
thing to get men or even the preachers
to do. Laymen there are who will give
their money&mdash;some of them in rich abundance&mdash;but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
they will not &#8220;give themselves&#8221;
to prayer, without which their money is
but a curse. There are plenty of preachers
who will preach and deliver great and eloquent
addresses on the need of revival and
the spread of the kingdom of God, but not
many there are who will do that without
which all preaching and organizing are
worse than vain&mdash;pray. It is out of date,
almost a lost art, and the greatest benefactor
this age could have is the man who will
bring the preachers and the Church back
to prayer.</p>

<p><i>I judge that my prayer is more than the devil himself;
if it were otherwise, Luther would have fared
differently long before this. Yet men will not see and
acknowledge the great wonders or miracles God works
in my behalf. If I should neglect prayer but a single
day, I should lose a great deal of the fire of faith.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Martin Luther.</span></p></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Only</span> glimpses of the great importance
of prayer could the apostles get before Pentecost.
But the Spirit coming and filling
on Pentecost elevated prayer to its vital
and all-commanding position in the gospel
of Christ. The call now of prayer to every
saint is the Spirit&#8217;s loudest and most exigent
call. Sainthood&#8217;s piety is made, refined,
perfected, by prayer. The gospel moves
with slow and timid pace when the saints
are not at their prayers early and late and
long.</p>

<p>Where are the Christly leaders who can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
teach the modern saints how to pray and
put them at it? Do we know we are raising
up a prayerless set of saints? Where
are the apostolic leaders who can put God&#8217;s
people to praying? Let them come to the
front and do the work, and it will be the
greatest work which can be done. An increase
of educational facilities and a great
increase of money force will be the direst
curse to religion if they are not sanctified
by more and better praying than we are
doing. More praying will not come as a
matter of course. The campaign for the
twentieth or thirtieth century fund will not
help our praying but hinder if we are not
careful. Nothing but a specific effort from
a praying leadership will avail. The chief
ones must lead in the apostolic effort to
radicate the vital importance and <i>fact</i> of
prayer in the heart and life of the Church.
None but praying leaders can have praying
followers. Praying apostles will beget
praying saints. A praying pulpit will beget
praying pews. We do greatly need somebody
who can set the saints to this business<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
of praying. We are not a generation of
praying saints. Nonpraying saints are a
beggarly gang of saints who have neither
the ardor nor the beauty nor the power of
saints. Who will restore this breach? The
greatest will he be of reformers and apostles,
who can set the Church to praying.</p>

<p>We put it as our most sober judgment
that the great need of the Church in this
and all ages is men of such commanding
faith, of such unsullied holiness, of such
marked spiritual vigor and consuming zeal,
that their prayers, faith, lives, and ministry
will be of such a radical and aggressive
form as to work spiritual revolutions which
will form eras in individual and Church
life.</p>

<p>We do not mean men who get up sensational
stirs by novel devices, nor those who
attract by a pleasing entertainment; but
men who can stir things, and work revolutions
by the preaching of God&#8217;s Word and
by the power of the Holy Ghost, revolutions
which change the whole current of
things.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>Natural ability and educational advantages
do not figure as factors in this matter;
but capacity for faith, the ability to
pray, the power of thorough consecration,
the ability of self-littleness, an absolute losing
of one&#8217;s self in God&#8217;s glory, and an
ever-present and insatiable yearning and
seeking after all the fullness of God&mdash;men
who can set the Church ablaze for God; not
in a noisy, showy way, but with an intense
and quiet heat that melts and moves everything
for God.</p>

<p>God can work wonders if he can get a
suitable man. Men can work wonders if
they can get God to lead them. The full
endowment of the spirit that turned the
world upside down would be eminently useful
in these latter days. Men who can stir
things mightily for God, whose spiritual
revolutions change the whole aspect of
things, are the universal need of the
Church.</p>

<p>The Church has never been without
these men; they adorn its history; they are
the standing miracles of the divinity of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
the Church; their example and history are
an unfailing inspiration and blessing. An
increase in their number and power should
be our prayer.</p>

<p>That which has been done in spiritual
matters can be done again, and be better
done. This was Christ&#8217;s view. He said:
&#8220;Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth
on me, the works that I do shall he
do also; and greater works than these shall
he do; because I go unto my Father.&#8221; The
past has not exhausted the possibilities nor
the demands for doing great things for
God. The Church that is dependent on its
past history for its miracles of power and
grace is a fallen Church.</p>

<p>God wants elect men&mdash;men out of whom
self and the world have gone by a severe
crucifixion, by a bankruptcy which has so
totally ruined self and the world that there
is neither hope nor desire of recovery; men
who by this insolvency and crucifixion have
turned toward God perfect hearts.</p>

<p>Let us pray ardently that God&#8217;s promise
to prayer may be more than realized.</p>
